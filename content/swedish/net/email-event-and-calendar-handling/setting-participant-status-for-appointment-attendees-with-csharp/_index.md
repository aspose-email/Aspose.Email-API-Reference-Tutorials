## Introduction to Aspose.Email for .NET

Aspose.Email for .NET is a versatile library that enables developers to work with email messages, appointments, contacts, and more within their .NET applications. With its intuitive API, developers can effortlessly manipulate various aspects of email communication, making it an excellent choice for handling appointment-related tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio (or any C# IDE)
- Aspose.Email for .NET library
- Basic understanding of C# programming

## Creating an Appointment

To get started, you need to create an appointment instance using Aspose.Email for .NET. An appointment represents a scheduled event, and you can set various properties like start time, end time, location, and more.

```csharp
// Add necessary using statements
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Appointment;

// Create an instance of the Appointment class
var appointment = new Appointment();

// Set appointment properties
appointment.StartTime = DateTime.Now;
appointment.EndTime = appointment.StartTime.AddHours(1);
appointment.Location = "Conference Room 101";
```

## Adding Attendees

Next, you can add attendees to the appointment using the `Attendees` collection. Attendees are the individuals who will be participating in the appointment. You can specify their email addresses and names.

```csharp
// Add attendees to the appointment
appointment.Attendees.Add("john@example.com", "John Doe");
appointment.Attendees.Add("jane@example.com", "Jane Smith");
```

## Setting Participant Status

Now comes the crucial part: setting the participant status for the attendees. Participant status indicates whether an attendee has accepted, declined, or tentatively accepted the appointment invitation. Aspose.Email for .NET provides different status options to choose from.

```csharp
// Set participant status for attendees
appointment.Attendees[0].ParticipantStatus = AppointmentParticipantStatus.Accepted;
appointment.Attendees[1].ParticipantStatus = AppointmentParticipantStatus.Declined;
```

## Complete Source Code

Here's the complete source code that demonstrates the process of creating an appointment, adding attendees, and setting participant status:

```csharp
// Add necessary using statements
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Appointment;

// Create an instance of the Appointment class
var appointment = new Appointment();

// Set appointment properties
appointment.StartTime = DateTime.Now;
appointment.EndTime = appointment.StartTime.AddHours(1);
appointment.Location = "Conference Room 101";

// Add attendees to the appointment
appointment.Attendees.Add("john@example.com", "John Doe");
appointment.Attendees.Add("jane@example.com", "Jane Smith");

// Set participant status for attendees
appointment.Attendees[0].ParticipantStatus = AppointmentParticipantStatus.Accepted;
appointment.Attendees[1].ParticipantStatus = AppointmentParticipantStatus.Declined;
```
