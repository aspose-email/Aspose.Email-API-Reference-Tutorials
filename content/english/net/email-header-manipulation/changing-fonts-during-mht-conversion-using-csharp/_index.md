## Introduction to MHT Conversion and Aspose.Email for .NET

### What is MHT?

MHT (MIME HTML) is a file format that allows you to save a web page, including all its resources, in a single document. It's often used for archiving web pages and email messages, as it retains the structure and appearance of the original content.

### About Aspose.Email for .NET

### Creating a New .NET Project

## Loading and Parsing an Email Message

### Loading an Email Message

Before we can modify the fonts in the email, we need to load an email message. You can load an email from various sources, such as a file, stream, or even a mail server.

```csharp
// Load the email message
var message = MailMessage.Load("sample.eml");
```

### Parsing the Message Body

Once the email is loaded, you can access its different parts, including the HTML body. Parsing the HTML body allows us to make font changes.

```csharp
// Parse the HTML body
var htmlBody = message.HtmlBody;
```

## Modifying Fonts in the Email

### Understanding Font Styles

Fonts in HTML emails are defined using CSS styles. To change fonts, you need to modify the CSS styles associated with the email's HTML content.

### Changing Fonts Programmatically

Let's say you want to change the font of a paragraph in the email's HTML body. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Change font of a paragraph
htmlBody = htmlBody.Replace("<p>", "<p style=\"font-family: Arial;\">");
```

## Converting to MHT Format

### Creating MHT Message

To convert the email to MHT format, you need to create an MHT-formatted email message using Aspose.Email.

```csharp
// Create MHT-formatted email message
var mhtMessage = MhtMessage.FromMailMessage(message);
```

### Saving the Message to MHT Format

Finally, save the MHT-formatted message to a file.

```csharp
// Save the message to MHT format
mhtMessage.Save("output.mht", SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml);
```

## Complete Source Code

Here's the complete source code that puts everything together:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Mhtml;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var message = MailMessage.Load("sample.eml");
        var htmlBody = message.HtmlBody;
        htmlBody = htmlBody.Replace("<p>", "<p style=\"font-family: Arial;\">");

        var mhtMessage = MhtMessage.FromMailMessage(message);
        mhtMessage.Save("output.mht", SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml);
    }
}
```
