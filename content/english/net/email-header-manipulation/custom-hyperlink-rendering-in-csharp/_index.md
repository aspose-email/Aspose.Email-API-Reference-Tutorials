This guide will walk you through the process of custom hyperlink rendering in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET. Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that enables you to work with emails, including various features like creating, reading, and manipulating email messages. In this tutorial, we will focus on how to customize hyperlink rendering in email messages using the library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio or any other C# development environment
- Aspose.Email for .NET library (You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net))
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and email concepts

## Steps

Follow the steps below to implement custom hyperlink rendering in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET:

### Step 1: Create a New C# Project

Open your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio) and create a new project.

### Step 2: Add Reference to Aspose.Email

Add a reference to the Aspose.Email for .NET library in your project. You can do this by right-clicking on your project in the Solution Explorer, selecting "Add" > "Reference," and then browsing to the location where you saved the Aspose.Email DLL.

### Step 3: Initialize the MailMessage Object

Create a new instance of the `MailMessage` class from the Aspose.Email library. This class represents an email message.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// ...

MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

### Step 4: Create a Hyperlink

Create a `Hyperlink` object and set its properties, such as URL and display text.

```csharp
Hyperlink hyperlink = new Hyperlink("https://www.example.com", "Visit our website");
```

### Step 5: Customize Hyperlink Rendering

Customize the rendering of the hyperlink using the `TextFormattingCallback` property. This property allows you to specify a callback function that will be invoked when rendering the hyperlink.

```csharp
message.TextFormattingCallback = (sender, args) =>
{
    if (args.Hyperlink != null)
    {
        // Customize hyperlink rendering here
        string formattedText = $"[CustomLink: {args.Hyperlink.Text}]({args.Hyperlink.Uri})";
        args.FormattedText = formattedText;
        args.IsHandled = true; // Indicate that custom rendering is done
    }
};
```

In the above code, the callback function receives the `Hyperlink` object and can manipulate its properties to customize the rendering. In this example, we're formatting the hyperlink using Markdown-style syntax.

### Step 6: Add Hyperlink to the Email Body

Add the customized hyperlink to the email body.

```csharp
message.HtmlBody = "Please click the following link: [CustomLink: Visit our website](https://www.example.com)";
```

### Step 7: Save or Send the Email

You can now save the email to a file or send it using the SMTP server of your choice.

```csharp
message.Save("custom_hyperlink_email.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

## FAQs

### How do I customize the hyperlink rendering further?

You can customize the hyperlink rendering further by modifying the callback function in Step 5. You can change the formatting, apply CSS styles, or even create complex HTML structures for rendering hyperlinks.

### Can I customize hyperlinks in plain text emails?

Yes, you can. In Step 5, you can check the `args.IsHtml` property to determine whether the rendering is for an HTML email or a plain text email. Then, you can apply your customization accordingly.

### Where can I find more information about Aspose.Email for .NET?

You can find detailed documentation and code examples for Aspose.Email for .NET in the [official documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to customize hyperlink rendering in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET. By leveraging the `TextFormattingCallback` property, you can have full control over how hyperlinks are displayed in your email messages. This allows you to create visually appealing and personalized email content.
