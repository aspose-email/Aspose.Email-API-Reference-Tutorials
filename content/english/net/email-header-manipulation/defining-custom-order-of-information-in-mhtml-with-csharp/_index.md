In the realm of email management, the ability to customize the order of information in MHTML emails is a valuable feature. Aspose.Email for .NET offers a robust solution for achieving this. In this article, we will guide you through the process step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Scenario

Before delving into the technical details, let's grasp the scenario. Imagine you have an email message, and you want to save it in MHTML format with specific headers and in a custom order. The headers you want to include are 'From,' 'Subject,' 'To,' 'Sent,' and 'Attachments.'

## Step 2: Setting Up the Development Environment

To begin, ensure that Aspose.Email for .NET is installed in your development environment. If you haven't done this already, you can download it from the [Aspose.Email for .NET Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).

Once the installation is complete, create a new C# project and add a reference to the Aspose.Email assembly. This step is crucial to access the functionality we need.

## Step 3: Writing the Code

Now, let's dive into the code implementation. Below is the code that accomplishes our goal:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";

MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "Attachments.eml");
MhtSaveOptions opt = SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml;

eml.Save(dataDir + "CustomOrderOfInformationInMHTML_1.mhtml", opt);

opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.From);
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.Subject);
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.To);
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.Sent);

eml.Save(dataDir + "CustomOrderOfInformationInMHTML_2.mhtml", opt);

opt.RenderingHeaders.Clear();
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.Attachments);
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.Cc);
opt.RenderingHeaders.Add(MhtTemplateName.Subject);

eml.Save(dataDir + "CustomOrderOfInformationInMHTML_3.mhtml", opt);
```

In this code, we first load the email message and configure the MHTML save options. Then, we save the email in MHTML format multiple times, each time specifying the desired rendering headers. This process ensures the custom order of information in the MHTML file.
