## Introduction to Preserving Original Boundaries

In the modern business world, email communication plays a pivotal role. As emails are exchanged, they often contain crucial attachments that need to be managed and manipulated programmatically. However, when working with email attachments, it's essential to ensure that the original boundaries and formatting of these attachments are preserved. This is where Aspose.Email for .NET comes into play.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio installed
- .NET Framework or .NET Core project

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the Aspose.Email for .NET library. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
3. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
4. Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the package.

## Loading Email Messages

The first step is to load the email message that contains the attachment you want to work with. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mail;

// Load the email message
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/email.msg");
```

## Extracting Attachments

Once you have the email message loaded, you can extract the attachments from it:

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    // Extract attachment data
    byte[] attachmentData = attachment.ContentStream.ToByteArray();
    string fileName = attachment.Name;
    // Further processing...
}
```

## Modifying Attachments

To preserve the original boundaries while modifying attachments, you can use the Aspose.Email library's features. Let's say you want to resize an image attachment:

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType.StartsWith("image/"))
    {
        // Resize the image while preserving original boundaries
        using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream(attachmentData))
        {
            // Perform image manipulation
            // Save changes to memoryStream
        }
    }
}
```

## Saving Changes

After making modifications to the attachments, you can save the changes back to the email message:

```csharp
// Save changes to the original email message
message.Save("path/to/modified-email.msg", SaveOptions.DefaultMsg);
```

## Conclusion

Preserving original boundaries when working with email attachments is crucial for maintaining data integrity. With Aspose.Email for .NET, this process becomes seamless, allowing you to manipulate attachments while ensuring that their formatting remains intact.
