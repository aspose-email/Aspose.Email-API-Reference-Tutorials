## Installation of Aspose.Email NuGet Package

To begin, make sure you have a .NET project set up. You can install the Aspose.Email NuGet package by using the following command in your project's Package Manager Console:

```csharp
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

## Initializing the Application

Initialize the Aspose.Email library in your application by adding the necessary using directive and creating an instance of the `MailMessage` class:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Initialize the application
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

## Loading Calendar Data

## Creating an Instance of Calendar

To work with calendar events, you'll need to create an instance of the `Calendar` class from the Aspose.Email library:

```csharp
Calendar calendar = new Calendar();
```

## Loading Calendar Data from ICS File

You can load calendar data from an ICS (iCalendar) file using the `CalendarReader` class:

```csharp
CalendarReader reader = new CalendarReader("path/to/your/calendar.ics");
Calendar loadedCalendar = reader.Read();
```

## Rendering Calendar Events

## Creating a Rendered Output Container

To render calendar events, you need a container to hold the output. You can create an HTML container using the `HtmlView` class:

```csharp
HtmlView htmlView = new HtmlView();
```

## Applying Rendering Options

Before rendering, you can apply various options to customize the appearance of the output. For example, you can set the start and end dates for rendering:

```csharp
htmlView.CalendarStart = DateTime.Today;
htmlView.CalendarEnd = DateTime.Today.AddDays(7);
```

## Rendering Calendar Events

Render the calendar events using the `Render` method:

```csharp
string renderedOutput = htmlView.Render(calendar);
```

## Customization

## Styling the Rendered Output

You can style the rendered output by modifying the CSS properties of the HTML container:

```csharp
htmlView.Styles = "body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }";
```

## Adding Event Details

Enhance the rendered output by adding event details, such as event names and descriptions:

```csharp
htmlView.EventFormatter = (eventInfo) =>
{
    return $"<b>{eventInfo.StartDate}: {eventInfo.Summary}</b><br>{eventInfo.Description}<br><br>";
};
```

## Handling User Interaction

## Responding to User Clicks

You can make the rendered events interactive by responding to user clicks. For example, opening event details when an event is clicked:

```csharp
htmlView.EventClick += (sender, eventArgs) =>
{
    EventInfo clickedEvent = eventArgs.Event;
    // Handle event click logic here
};
```

## Navigating Through Events

Enable users to navigate through events using navigation buttons:

```csharp
htmlView.ShowNavigation = true;
```

## Error Handling

## Handling Loading and Rendering Errors

It's important to handle potential errors when loading and rendering calendar data:

```csharp
try
{
    Calendar loadedCalendar = reader.Read();
    string renderedOutput = htmlView.Render(loadedCalendar);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle loading or rendering errors
}
```
