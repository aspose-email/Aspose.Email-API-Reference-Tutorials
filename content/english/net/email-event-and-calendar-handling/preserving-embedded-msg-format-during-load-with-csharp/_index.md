In today's digital world, email communication plays a pivotal role in both personal and professional spheres. Many times, we need to work with email files programmatically, and preserving the original boundaries of an EML (Email) file can be crucial. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to achieve this using C# code with Aspose.Email for .NET.

## Introduction

When working with EML files, it's essential to retain their original boundaries to ensure the integrity of the email content. Aspose.Email for .NET provides a simple and efficient way to do this. We will walk you through the process, starting with the necessary code snippet.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Email for .NET: If you haven't already, download and install Aspose.Email for .NET from the website: [Download Aspose.Email for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).

## Step 1: Load the EML File

The first step is to load the EML file that you want to work with. Make sure you specify the correct path to the file directory in your code.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
MailMessage mailMessage = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "Attachments.eml");
```

## Step 2: Save as EML with Preserved Original Boundaries

Now, we will save the loaded email message as an EML file while preserving its original boundaries. This is where Aspose.Email for .NET comes into play. We'll use the `EmlSaveOptions` class with the `PreserveOriginalBoundaries` property set to `true`.

```csharp
EmlSaveOptions emlSaveOptions = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.EmlFormat)
{
    PreserveOriginalBoundaries = true
};
mailMessage.Save(dataDir + "PreserveOriginalBoundaries_out.eml", emlSaveOptions);
```
