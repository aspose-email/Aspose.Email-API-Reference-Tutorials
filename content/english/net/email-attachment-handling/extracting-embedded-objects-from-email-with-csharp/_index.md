## Introduction to Embedded Objects in Emails

Embedded objects in emails refer to files that are directly inserted into the email content rather than being attached separately. These objects enrich the email experience by allowing the sender to include images, animations, or interactive content within the message body.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Email for .NET

Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that provides various features for working with emails, including parsing, creation, and manipulation of email messages. To get started, you need to have the Aspose.Email for .NET library installed in your project. You can either download it from the official website or use a package manager like NuGet.

## Loading and Parsing an Email

To extract embedded objects from an email, you first need to load and parse the email message. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Import the necessary namespaces
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mail;

// Load the email message
var message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/your/email.eml");
```

## Identifying and Extracting Embedded Objects

Once the email message is loaded, you can iterate through its AlternateViews to identify and extract embedded objects. AlternateViews represent different formats of the email, including HTML and plain text. Embedded objects are often found in the HTML view.

```csharp
// Iterate through alternate views
foreach (var view in message.AlternateViews)
{
    if (view.ContentType.MediaType == "text/html")
    {
        // Extract embedded objects from HTML content
        foreach (var linkedResource in view.LinkedResources)
        {
            // Extract and save the linked resource (embedded object)
            linkedResource.Save("path/to/save/" + linkedResource.ContentId);
        }
    }
}
```

## Saving Extracted Objects

Once you've identified and extracted the embedded objects, you can save them to your desired location. The ContentId of the linked resource is often used as the filename.

## Complete Source Code

Here's the complete source code for extracting embedded objects from an email using Aspose.Email for .NET:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mail;

namespace EmbeddedObjectExtractor
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Load the email message
            var message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/your/email.eml");

            // Iterate through alternate views
            foreach (var view in message.AlternateViews)
            {
                if (view.ContentType.MediaType == "text/html")
                {
                    // Extract embedded objects from HTML content
                    foreach (var linkedResource in view.LinkedResources)
                    {
                        // Extract and save the linked resource (embedded object)
                        linkedResource.Save("path/to/save/" + linkedResource.ContentId);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
