## Introduction to TNEF Attachments and Aspose.Email for .NET

TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) attachments are a proprietary format used by Microsoft Outlook to package rich text and attachments within emails. Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to work with emails in various formats, including TNEF attachments, using C#.

foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "application/ms-tnef")
    {
        // Extract TNEF attachment
        var tnefAttachment = (TnefAttachment)attachment;

        // Access TNEF properties and modify if necessary
        // tnefAttachment.Properties...
    }
}
```

## Saving the Email with Modified Attachments
