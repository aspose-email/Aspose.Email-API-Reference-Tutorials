This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of including attachments in your email using the Aspose.Email library for .NET.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into the coding details, ensure you have a suitable development environment. You'll need:

## Creating an Email Message

Now that Aspose.Email is integrated into your project, let's begin creating an email message:

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a new email message
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();

        // Set sender and recipient addresses
        message.From = new MailAddress("sender@example.com");
        message.To.Add("recipient@example.com");

        // Set email subject and body

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Rest of your code...

        // Sending the email using an SMTP client
        SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587);
        client.Username = "your_username";
        client.Password = "your_password";
