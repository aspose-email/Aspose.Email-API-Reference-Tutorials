Aspose.Email for Java is a powerful Java library that empowers developers to work with email messages programmatically. It provides a wide range of features and functionalities for creating, manipulating, and managing emails, making it an ideal choice for businesses and developers looking to enhance their email communication.

## Understanding Email Headers

Before diving into custom headers, let's understand what email headers are. Email headers are an integral part of every email message, containing vital information about the message's origin, recipients, subject, and more. These headers are typically hidden from the average email user but are crucial for email servers and clients to process messages correctly.

## Custom Headers in Outgoing Emails

Custom headers in outgoing emails allow you to add additional information to your email messages. This can be useful for various purposes, such as categorizing emails, adding tracking information, or implementing custom features in your email client.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Custom Headers

Adding custom headers to your outgoing emails using Aspose.Email for Java is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to customize your email headers:

### 1. Import the Aspose.Email Library

To get started, you need to include the Aspose.Email library in your Java project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).

### 2. Create an Email Message

Next, create an email message object using Aspose.Email. You can set the sender, recipients, subject, and body of the email as usual.

### 3. Add Custom Headers

To add custom headers, use the `addCustomHeader` method of the email message object. You can specify the header name and its value as parameters.

message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
message.setTo("recipient@example.com");
message.setSubject("Custom Headers Example");
message.setHtmlBody("<p>Hello, world!</p>");

// Adding a custom header
message.addCustomHeader("X-Custom-Header", "MyCustomValue");
```

### 4. Send the Email

Once you have added the custom headers, send the email using Aspose.Email. The custom headers will be included in the outgoing message.

```java
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", "username", "password");
client.send(message);
```

That's it! You've successfully added custom headers to your outgoing email.
