## Introduction

Aspose.Email for Java allows you to track sent emails, enabling you to monitor their delivery and recipient interactions. In this guide, you'll learn how to track sent emails step-by-step using Aspose.Email for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment on your system.

2. Aspose.Email for Java Library: Download the Aspose.Email for Java library from the official download link:

   [Aspose.Email for Java Download](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/)

   Add the downloaded JAR files to your Java project's classpath for email manipulation.

## Step 1: Set up your Java environment

Verify that Java and Aspose.Email for Java are installed and correctly configured in your development environment.

## Step 2: Create a new Java project

Initiate a new Java project in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Step 3: Add Aspose.Email for Java library

Download the Aspose.Email for Java library from the official link mentioned earlier. Add the JAR files to your project's classpath.

## Step 4: Import Aspose.Email classes

In your Java code, import the necessary Aspose.Email classes:

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;
```

## Step 5: Create an Email Message

Design your email message using the `MailMessage` class. Set the subject, sender, recipients, and content for the email you want to track.

## Step 6: Track the Sent Email

Use Aspose.Email for Java's tracking capabilities to monitor the sent email:

```java
// Create an instance of the SmtpClient class with your SMTP server details
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", "username", "password");

// Send the email and get the message id
String messageId = client.send(message);

// Use the message id for tracking purposes
System.out.println("Email sent successfully. Message ID: " + messageId);
```

## Step 7: Monitor Email Delivery and Interactions

You can use the message id obtained in step 6 to monitor email delivery status, opens, clicks, and other interactions through additional tracking tools or services.

## Step 8: Complete the program

Here's the complete Java program:

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;

public class EmailTracking {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an email message
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
        message.setSubject("Tracking Email Example");
        message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
        message.setTo("recipient@example.com");
        message.setHtmlBody("<html><body><p>This email is being tracked.</p></body></html>");

        // Create an instance of the SmtpClient class with your SMTP server details
        SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", "username", "password");

        try {
            // Send the email and get the message id
            String messageId = client.send(message);
            System.out.println("Email sent successfully. Message ID: " + messageId);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            System.out.println("Error sending email: " + ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
