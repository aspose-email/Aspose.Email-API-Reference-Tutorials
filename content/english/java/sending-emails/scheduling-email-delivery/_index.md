// Schedule the email for delivery
message.setDeliveryTime(calendar.getTime());
```

## Step 7: Save or send the scheduled email

        message.setTo("recipient@example.com");
        message.setHtmlBody("<html><body><p>This email is scheduled for delivery.</p></body></html>");

        // Create a new instance of the Calendar class
        Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

        // Set the desired delivery date and time
