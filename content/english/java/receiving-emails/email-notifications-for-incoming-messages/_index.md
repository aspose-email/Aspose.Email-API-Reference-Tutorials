In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing email notifications for incoming messages using Aspose.Email for Java. Whether you want to create real-time notifications for your email system or enhance your application's communication capabilities, Aspose.Email provides the tools you need.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Aspose.Email for Java: Download and set up Aspose.Email for Java from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).

## Step 1: Create a Java Project
Start by creating a new Java project in your favorite integrated development environment (IDE).

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;

public class EmailNotificationApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code goes here
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Connect to an Email Account
To receive incoming messages, you need to connect to your email account. Aspose.Email simplifies this process.

```java
// Set up your email account credentials
String username = "your-email@example.com";
String password = "your-password";

// Create an instance of the ImapClient class
ImapClient client = new ImapClient("imap.example.com", 993, username, password, SecurityOptions.Auto);
```

## Step 3: Monitor Incoming Messages
With Aspose.Email, you can easily monitor incoming messages in real-time using the `ImapClient`.

```java
// Subscribe to the NewMessage event
client.addNewMessageListener(new NewMessageListener() {
    public void newMessageReceived(NewMessageEventArgs args) {
        // Handle the incoming message here
    }
});

// Start monitoring
client.startMonitoring();
```

## Step 4: Handle Incoming Messages
When a new message is received, you can define custom actions to handle it.

```java
// Handle incoming messages
public void handleIncomingMessage(MailMessage message) {
    // Your custom logic here
}
```
