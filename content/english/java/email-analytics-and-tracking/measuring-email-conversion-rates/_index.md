double conversionRate = calculateConversionRate(campaignData);
```

## Step 4: Display Results

Displaying the calculated conversion rates is essential for analysis. You can present this information in a user-friendly format, such as a console output or a graphical chart.

```java
// Display conversion rates
System.out.println("Open Rate: " + openRate + "%");
System.out.println("CTR: " + ctr + "%");
System.out.println("Conversion Rate: " + conversionRate + "%");
```
