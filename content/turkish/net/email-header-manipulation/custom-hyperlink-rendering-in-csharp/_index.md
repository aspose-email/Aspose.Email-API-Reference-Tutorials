In the world of email communications, making hyperlinks stand out and look appealing is crucial for grabbing the reader's attention. As a proficient SEO writer, I will guide you through the process of custom hyperlink rendering in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET. We'll explore how to enhance the appearance of hyperlinks in your email messages, making them more engaging for your recipients.

## Introduction

Emails often contain hyperlinks that direct users to websites or other resources. By default, these hyperlinks appear as plain text in the email body. However, with Aspose.Email for .NET, you can customize the rendering of hyperlinks, adding style and enhancing their visibility.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure we have everything set up correctly. You'll need to have Aspose.Email for .NET installed and create a C# project. Make sure to include the necessary Aspose.Email references.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace CustomHyperlinkRendering
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set your data directory path
            string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
            var fileName = dataDir + "LinksSample.eml";
            MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(fileName);

            // Render hyperlinks with href
            string renderedHtmlWithHref = RenderHyperlinkWithHref(msg.GetHtmlBodyText());

            // Render hyperlinks without href
            string renderedHtmlWithoutHref = RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref(msg.GetHtmlBodyText());

            Console.WriteLine("Hyperlinks with Href:");
            Console.WriteLine(renderedHtmlWithHref);

            Console.WriteLine("Hyperlinks without Href:");
            Console.WriteLine(renderedHtmlWithoutHref);
        }

        // Custom hyperlink rendering methods will be implemented here
    }
}
```

## Rendering Hyperlinks with Href

In the provided source code, we have two methods: `RenderHyperlinkWithHref` and `RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref`. Let's begin with the first one, which renders hyperlinks along with the `href` attribute.

```csharp
private static string RenderHyperlinkWithHref(string source)
{
    int start = source.IndexOf("href=\"") + "href=\"".Length;
    int end = source.IndexOf("\"", start + "href=\"".Length);
    string href = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    start = source.IndexOf(">") + 1;
    end = source.IndexOf("<", start);
    string text = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    string link = string.Format("{0}<{1}>", text, href);
    return link;
}
```

This method extracts the `href` attribute and the link text from the HTML source and combines them to create a custom hyperlink.

## Rendering Hyperlinks without Href

Now, let's move on to the `RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref` method, which renders hyperlinks without the `href` attribute.

```csharp
private static string RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref(string source)
{
    int start = source.IndexOf(">") + 1;
    int end = source.IndexOf("<", start);
    string text = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    return text;
}
```

This method extracts the link text directly from the HTML source, excluding the `href` attribute.
