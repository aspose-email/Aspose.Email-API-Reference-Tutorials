Let's dive into the prerequisites before getting started.

## المتطلبات الأساسية
Before implementing these features, you'll need to ensure that your development environment is ready. Here’s what you’ll require:

- **Aspose.Email for Java**: This library provides functionalities to work with email files, including PSTs.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 16 or later installed as Aspose.Email for Java is compatible with it.
- **IDE**: An Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will be helpful for writing and testing your code.

### Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
To begin, you need to integrate the Aspose.Email library into your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

```

## دليل التنفيذ
In this section, we will break down the features provided by Aspose.Email for handling PST files.

### Load a PST File
This feature demonstrates loading an Outlook PST file using Aspose.Email for Java.

#### ملخص
Loading a PST file is the first step in accessing its content. This allows you to explore folders and messages within the file programmatically.

```java
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;

public class LoadPSTFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the directory containing the PST file.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";

        // Load the Outlook PST file from the specified path.
        PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "PersonalStorage.pst");
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: ال `fromFile` طريقة `PersonalStorage` is used to load a PST file from your specified directory. It’s essential to set the correct path in `dataDir`.

### Display Folder and Message Information for a PST File
Next, let's browse through folders in a PST file to display their names, message counts, etc.

#### ملخص
This feature helps you enumerate all subfolders within a PST file, providing detailed information about each one.

```java
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;

public class DisplayFolderAndMessageInformation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the directory containing the PST file.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";

        // Load the Outlook PST file from the specified path.
        PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "PersonalStorage.pst");

        // Retrieve the collection of subfolders in the root folder.
        FolderInfoCollection folderInfoCollection = pst.getRootFolder().getSubFolders();

        // Iterate through each folder to display its details.
        for (int i = 0; i < folderInfoCollection.size(); i++) {
            FolderInfo folderInfo = folderInfoCollection.get_Item(i);

            // Display folder information including ID, name, total items, and unread item count.
            System.out.println("FolderId: " + folderInfo.getEntryIdString());
            System.out.println("Folder: " + folderInfo.getDisplayName());
            System.out.println("Total items: " + folderInfo.getContentCount());
            System.out.println("Total unread items: " + folderInfo.getContentUnreadCount());
            System.out.println("-----------------------------------");
        }
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: ال `getRootFolder().getSubFolders()` method retrieves all subfolders in the PST file's root. Each folder’s details, including its ID and message counts, are printed out.

### Parse Searchable Folders in a PST File
This feature categorizes and lists subfolders based on their type—Search or Normal.

#### ملخص
Parsing folders helps you identify and process different types of searchable content within the PST file.

```java
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
import com.aspose.email.FolderKind;

public class ParseSearchableFolders {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the directory containing the PST file.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";

        // Load the Outlook PST file from the specified path.
        final PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "PersonalStorage.pst");

        // Retrieve a specific folder by its ID.
        FolderInfo finder = pst.getFolderById("AAAAAOu+OWXNsrFFkK4GgGGmk0yCgAAA");

        // Get subfolders categorized as Search folders and display their count.
        FolderInfoCollection coll = finder.getSubFolders(FolderKind.Search);
        System.out.println(coll.size());

        // Get subfolders categorized as Normal folders and display their count.
        coll = finder.getSubFolders(FolderKind.Normal);
        System.out.println(coll.size());

        // Get all subfolders (both Search and Normal) and display their total count.
        coll = finder.getSubFolders(FolderKind.Search | FolderKind.Normal);
        System.out.println(coll.size());
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: By using `getFolderById`, we target a specific folder. The `getSubFolders` method is then used to filter folders based on their type—Search or Normal.

### Retrieve Parent Folder Information from Message Info
This feature extracts the parent folder information for each message within a PST file's folders.

#### ملخص
Retrieving parent folder details allows you to understand where messages are stored in the hierarchy of your PST file.

```java
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.MessageInfo;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
import com.aspose.email.IDisposable;

public class RetrieveParentFolderInformation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the directory containing the PST file.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";

        // Load the Outlook PST file from the specified path.
        PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "PersonalStorage.pst");

        // Retrieve a specific folder by its ID and process message information.
        FolderInfo folderInfo = pst.getRootFolder().getSubFolders().get_Item(0); // Example to get the first subfolder
        for (MessageInfo messageInfo : folderInfo.getContents()) {
            System.out.println("Subject: " + messageInfo.getSubject());
            System.out.println("Parent Folder: " + folderInfo.getDisplayName());
            // Additional processing can be added here
        }
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: This example iterates through messages in a specific folder, printing out each message's subject and parent folder information.
