#### ملخص
This feature allows you to delete items individually based on specific conditions, such as email subject.
#### دليل خطوة بخطوة
##### Import Required Packages
Start by importing necessary classes:
```java
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.MessageInfo;
import com.aspose.email.MessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
import com.aspose.email.StandardIpmFolder;
```
##### تحميل ملف PST
Define your document directory and load the PST file:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "/SampleContacts.pst");
```
##### Access the Contacts Folder
Retrieve the contacts folder where emails are stored:
```java
FolderInfo folderInfo = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Contacts);
MessageInfoCollection messageInfoCollection = folderInfo.getContents();
```
##### Iterate and Delete Based on Condition
Loop through each email and delete if it matches your condition:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < messageInfoCollection.size(); i++) {
    MessageInfo messageInfo = (MessageInfo) messageInfoCollection.get_Item(i);
    if (messageInfo.getSubject().contains("Sebastian")) {
        folderInfo.deleteChildItem(messageInfo.getEntryId());
    }
}
```
### Feature 2: Delete Items in Bulk from a PST File
#### ملخص
For bulk deletions, this feature uses query conditions to efficiently remove multiple emails.
#### دليل خطوة بخطوة
##### Import Required Packages
```java
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.MessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorageQueryBuilder;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
##### Load the PST File and Dispose Properly
Ensure resources are managed by using a try-finally block:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(dataDir + "/SampleContacts.pst");
try {
    // Bulk deletion logic here
} finally {
    pst.dispose();
}
```
##### Create and Execute Query
Define your query to filter emails from a specific sender:
```java
FolderInfo inbox = pst.getRootFolder().getSubFolder("Contacts");
PersonalStorageQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new PersonalStorageQueryBuilder();
queryBuilder.getFrom().contains("someuser@domain.com");

MessageInfoCollection messages = inbox.getContents(queryBuilder.getQuery());
```
##### Collect and Delete Entries
Gather entry IDs and delete in bulk:
```java
ArrayList<String> deleteList = new ArrayList<>();
for (MessageInfo messageInfo : messages) {
    deleteList.add(messageInfo.getEntryIdString());
}
inbox.deleteChildItems(deleteList);
```
