# Customizing SMTP Headers and Footers with Aspose.Email


## مقدمة

In the digital age, emails have become the backbone of professional communication. They serve as a means to convey information, build relationships, and market products or services. However, the default headers and footers in email messages may not always align with your branding or communication style. This is where customizing SMTP headers and footers comes into play.

## المتطلبات الأساسية

MailMessage message = new MailMessage();

// Set sender and recipient
message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
message.setTo("recipient@example.com");

// Set subject
message.setSubject("Customized Email Header and Footer");
```

### Step 4: Customizing Headers

Now, let's customize the email headers. You can set headers like 'X-Priority', 'X-Mailer', and more to personalize your message. Here's an example:

```java
// Customize headers
message.getHeaders().add("X-Priority", "1");
message.getHeaders().add("X-Mailer", "Aspose.Email");
```

### Step 5: Customizing Footers

To customize the email footer, you can add your own text or signature. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Customize footer
String footerText = "This email is sent using Aspose.Email for Java.";
message.setHtmlBody("<p>Your email content here.</p><p>" + footerText + "</p>");
```

### Step 6: Sending the Email

Finally, send the email with the customized headers and footers:

```java
// Initialize the SMTP client
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "username", "password");

// Send the message
client.send(message);
