## دليل التنفيذ

Let's break down the implementation into two main features: setting up an IMAP client and creating a mail message.

### إعداد عميل IMAP

**ملخص:** This feature will guide you through configuring your Java application to connect to an email server using the IMAP protocol, specifically for Gmail in this example.

#### الخطوة 1: تهيئة ImapClient
إنشاء مثيل لـ `ImapClient` which serves as a gateway to connecting with your mail server.

```java
ImapClient client = new ImapClient();
```

#### Step 2: Configure Host and Port
Set up connection details specific to Gmail's IMAP server:

```java
client.setHost("imap.gmail.com");
client.setPort(993);
```
*لماذا؟* This ensures you connect securely using the standard port for SSL connections.

#### Step 3: Provide Credentials
Authenticate with your email account by setting the username and password:

```java
client.setUsername("username"); // Replace with actual username
client.setPassword("password"); // Replace with actual password
```

#### Step 4: Set Security Options
Ensure secure communication by configuring security settings:

```java
client.setSecurityOptions(SecurityOptions.Auto);
```
*لماذا؟* This automatically selects the best available security option, enhancing both compatibility and safety.

```
*لماذا؟* This setup allows you to customize the sender, recipient, subject, and message body easily.

## التطبيقات العملية

Here are some real-world scenarios where setting up an IMAP client and creating mail messages can be beneficial:

1. **الإشعارات التلقائية:** Automatically send notifications or reports via email based on application events.
