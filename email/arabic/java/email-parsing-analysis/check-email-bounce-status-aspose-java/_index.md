#### ملخص
This feature demonstrates loading an individual email file to determine if it has bounced, obtaining basic details about the bounce.

#### خطوات التنفيذ
**Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
Start by importing necessary classes:

```java
import com.aspose.email.BounceResult;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
```

**Step 2: Load an Email Message File**
Specify the directory and file name for your email message, then load it using `MailMessage.load()`.

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";
String fileName = "failed.msg";
MailMessage mail = MailMessage.load(dataDir + fileName);
```

**Step 3: Check Bounce Status**
استخدم `checkBounced()` method to determine if the email has bounced and retrieve basic bounce details:

```java
BounceResult result = mail.checkBounced();
```

**Step 4: Accessing Bounce Properties**
Access properties like bounce status, action taken due to bounce, and recipient information:

```java
System.out.println("IsBounced : " + result.isBounced());
System.out.println("Action : " + result.getAction());
System.out.println("Recipient : " + result.getRecipient());
```

### Load and Check Detailed Bounce Status of an Email Message

#### ملخص
This feature extends the first by retrieving detailed information about why the email bounced.

#### خطوات التنفيذ
Follow similar steps as before, but access more properties for comprehensive details:
**Step 1 to Step 3:** Same as in Feature 1.

**Step 4: Access Detailed Bounce Properties**
In addition to basic properties, obtain detailed bounce reasons and status:

```java
System.out.println("Reason : " + result.getReason());
System.out.println("Status : " + result.getStatus());
System.out.println("OriginalMessage ToAddress 1: " + 
    result.getOriginalMessage().getTo().get_Item(0).getAddress());
```

### Load and Check Bounce Status of Another Email Message

#### ملخص
The third feature illustrates the process for a different email file, emphasizing reusability.

**خطوات التنفيذ:** Follow steps similar to those in Feature 1, adjusting the filename as needed:

```java
String fileName = "test.eml";
