- **إعداد البيئة:** A Java Development Kit (JDK) of at least version 16 is required.
- **المتطلبات المعرفية:** Basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with email protocols.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

To begin, include the Aspose.Email library in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### الحصول على الترخيص

To fully utilize Aspose.Email, you'll need a license. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license for evaluation purposes. For production use, consider purchasing a license to unlock full features.

### التهيئة والإعداد الأساسي

Initialize your `ExchangeClient` with the necessary credentials:

```java
ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "username", "password", "domain");
```

## دليل التنفيذ

This section breaks down each feature into manageable steps, enabling you to implement complex email filtering functionalities.

### Filter Messages by Subject and Date

**ملخص:** This functionality filters emails in an Exchange mailbox based on specific subject keywords and internal dates.

#### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة:
1. **Initialize the Query Builder:**
   ```java
   SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss");
   ExchangeQueryBuilder builder = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
   builder.getSubject().contains("Newsletter");
   ```
2. **Set Date Filter:**
   ```java
   try {
       builder.getInternalDate().on(sdf.parse("10/05/2016 10:00:00"));
   } catch (ParseException e) {
       e.printStackTrace(); // Handle parsing errors gracefully
   }
   ```
3. **Execute the Query:**
   ```java
   MailQuery query = builder.getQuery();
   ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri(), query, false);
   ```

### Filter Messages Based on Today's Date

**ملخص:** Retrieve emails that arrived today.

#### Implementation:
1. **Build the Query:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderToday = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderToday.getInternalDate().on(new Date());
   ```
2. **List Messages:**
   Execute your query using `client.listMessages()` similar to previous examples, replacing the specific date with today's.

### Filter Messages Within a Specific Date Range

**ملخص:** Filter emails received before today and since one day ago.

#### Implementation:
1. **Configure Date Range:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderDateRange = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderDateRange.getInternalDate().beforeOrEqual(new Date());
   builderDateRange.getInternalDate().since(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(1)));
   ```

### Filter Messages Based on Specific Sender

**ملخص:** Fetch emails from a particular sender.

#### Implementation:
1. **Set Up the Query:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderSender = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderSender.getFrom().contains("saqib.razzaq@127.0.0.1");
   ```

### Filter Messages Based on Specific Domain

**ملخص:** Retrieve emails from a specific domain.

#### Implementation:
1. **Domain-Based Filtering:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderDomain = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderDomain.getFrom().contains("SpecificHost.com");
   ```

### Filter Messages Sent to Specific Recipient

**ملخص:** Fetch emails sent to a particular recipient.

#### Implementation:
1. **Recipient Query Setup:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderRecipient = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderRecipient.getTo().contains("recipient@example.com");
   ```

### Combine Queries with AND Logic

**ملخص:** Use logical AND operations to combine multiple conditions.

#### Implementation:
1. **Setup Combined Conditions:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderAnd = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderAnd.getFrom().contains("SpecificHost.com");
   builderAnd.getInternalDate().before(new Date());
   builderAnd.getInternalDate().since(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(-7)));
   ```

### Combine Queries with OR Logic

**ملخص:** Retrieve emails using logical OR conditions.

#### Implementation:
1. **OR Condition Setup:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderOr = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderOr.or(builderOr.getSubject().contains("test"), builderOr.getFrom().contains("noreply@host.com"));
   ```

### Filter Messages Based on Case Sensitivity

**ملخص:** Utilize case-sensitive filters for email addresses.

#### Implementation:
1. **Case-Sensitive Filtering:**
   ```java
   MailQueryBuilder builderCaseSensitive = new MailQueryBuilder();
   builderCaseSensitive.getFrom().contains("tesT", true);
   ```
