## دليل التنفيذ
Let's break down how you can extract emails from NSF files into manageable steps.

### Reading Messages from NSF Storage

#### ملخص
This feature allows you to read email messages stored in an NSF file using Aspose.Email for Java. 

##### 1. Necessary Imports
Ensure the following imports are included:
```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

```

##### 2. Define the Path to Your NSF File
Set up a directory path where your NSF files are stored.
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/email/";
```

##### 3. Initialize NotesStorageFacility with the Specified NSF File
إنشاء مثيل لـ `NotesStorageFacility` and specify the NSF file you want to read from.
```java
NotesStorageFacility nsf = new NotesStorageFacility(dataDir + "SampleNSF.nsf");
```

##### 4. Iterate Over Each Message in the NSF Storage
Use a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions and iterate over each email message:
```java
try {
    for (MailMessage eml : nsf.enumerateMessages()) {
        // Access properties like subject, sender, recipients here
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
