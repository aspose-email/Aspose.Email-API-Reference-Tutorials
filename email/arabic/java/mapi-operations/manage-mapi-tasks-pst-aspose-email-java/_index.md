## دليل التنفيذ

### Create and Configure a MAPI Task

Creating detailed tasks is straightforward with Aspose.Email. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Initialize a New MAPI Task
Create a task by specifying its subject, description, start date, and due date.

```java
MapiTask task = new MapiTask("To Do", "Just click and type to add new task", new Date(), new Date());
```

#### Step 2: Set Completion Percentage
Indicate how much of the task is complete using a percentage.

```java
task.setPercentComplete(20);
```

#### Step 3: Estimate Effort in Minutes
Define both estimated and actual time spent on the task.

```java
task.setEstimatedEffort(2000); // Estimated effort in minutes
task.setActualEffort(20);       // Actual effort in minutes
```

#### Step 4: Define Task History
Use history to indicate task status, such as assigned.

```java
task.setHistory(MapiTaskHistory.Assigned);
```

#### Step 5: Update the Last Modification Date
Keep track of when a task was last modified.

```java
task.setLastUpdate(new Date());
```

#### Step 6: Configure User Information
Set user-related details for task ownership and delegation.

```java
task.getUsers().setOwner("Darius");
task.getUsers().setLastAssigner("Harkness");
task.getUsers().setLastDelegate("Harkness");
task.getUsers().setOwnership(MapiTaskOwnership.AssignersCopy);
```

### Create and Configure a Personal Storage File (PST)

#### Step 1: Define Output Path
Specify where your PST file will be stored.

```java
String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "/TaskPST_out.pst";
```

#### Step 2: Create the PST File
Generate a new PST with Unicode support for better compatibility.

```java
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.create(outputPath, FileFormatVersion.Unicode);
```

### Create and Manage Task Folder in PST
Organize tasks by creating dedicated folders within your PST file.

#### Step 1: Reuse PST Creation Code
Follow the previous steps to create a PST file.

#### Step 2: Create 'Tasks' Folder
Generate a predefined folder for task management.

```java
FolderInfo taskFolder = pst.createPredefinedFolder("Tasks", StandardIpmFolder.Tasks);
```

#### Step 3: Add MAPI Task to the Folder
Insert your configured tasks into this new folder.

```java
taskFolder.addMapiMessageItem(task);
```
