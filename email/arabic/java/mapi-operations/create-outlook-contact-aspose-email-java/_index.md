    // Add a professional title
    contact.setProfessionalInfo(new MapiContactProfessionalPropertySet("Software Engineer"));
    
    // Define telephone numbers and addresses
    MapiContactTelephonePropertySet telephones = new MapiContactTelephonePropertySet();
    telephones.getHomeTelephoneNumber().setTelephoneNumber("123-456-7890");
    
    MapiContactPhysicalAddress address = new MapiContactPhysicalAddress(
        MapiContactPhysicalAddressPropertySet.AddressType.Business);
    address.setStreet1("123 Main St");
    contact.setPhysicalAddresses(Collections.singletonList(address));
}
