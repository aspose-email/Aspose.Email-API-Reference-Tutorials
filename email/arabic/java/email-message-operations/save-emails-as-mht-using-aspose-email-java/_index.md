## دليل التنفيذ

### Feature 1: Load MailMessage

#### ملخص
Loading an email message is the first step in processing and saving it as an MHT file. Here, we demonstrate how to load a `.msg` file using `MailMessage`.

#### Step-by-Step
**Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
```

**Load Email from File**

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/email/";
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg");
```
This snippet loads an email message located in your specified directory.

### Feature 2: Configure MhtSaveOptions

#### ملخص
تكوين `MhtSaveOptions` is crucial for defining how your email will be saved as an MHT file, including custom formatting for calendar events.

#### Step-by-Step
**Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.email.MhtSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.email.MhtFormatOptions;
import com.aspose.email.MhtTemplateName;
```

**Set Save Options and Templates**

```java
MhtSaveOptions options = new MhtSaveOptions();
options.setMhtFormatOptions(MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader | MhtFormatOptions.RenderCalendarEvent);

// Customize templates for email properties
for (Map.Entry<MhtTemplateName, String> entry : options.getFormatTemplates().entrySet()) {
    switch (entry.getKey()) {
        case START:
            options.getFormatTemplates().set_Item(MhtTemplateName.START,
                    "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
            break;
        // Add other cases similarly...
    }
}

// Ensure entries are added if absent
options.getFormatTemplates().addIfAbsent(MhtTemplateName.START,
            "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
```
This configuration sets up headers and calendar event rendering in the MHT output.

### Feature 3: Save MailMessage as MHT

#### ملخص
The final step is to save your configured `MailMessage` as an MHT file using the specified options.

#### Step-by-Step
**Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
import com.aspose.email.MhtSaveOptions;
```

**Save Email Message**

```java
msg.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences_out.mhtml", options);
```
This command writes the email to an MHT file, ready for sharing or archiving.

## التطبيقات العملية
- **أرشفة البريد الإلكتروني**: Convert and store important emails in a web-friendly format.
- **Legal Documentation**: Use MHT files as part of legal evidence where email details need preservation.
- **Cross-Platform Sharing**: Share emails across platforms without compatibility issues.

Integrating with other systems, such as CRM or project management tools, can enhance collaboration by embedding crucial email data directly into workflows.

## اعتبارات الأداء
لضمان الأداء الأمثل:
- Manage memory usage effectively when handling large batches of emails.
- Optimize file I/O operations to prevent bottlenecks during the save process.

Adhering to best practices in Java memory management will help maintain efficiency and responsiveness within your application.
