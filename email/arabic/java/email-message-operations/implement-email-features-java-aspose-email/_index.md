### Creating and Configuring a MailMessage
#### ملخص
Creating an email message involves initializing a `MailMessage` object, setting its properties like sender, recipient, subject, and body.

#### Steps to Create a MailMessage
1. **Initialize a MailMessage**
   
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

   // Declare message as MailMessage instance
   MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
   ```
   
2. **Set Email Properties**
   Customize the `MailMessage` with details such as sender, recipient, subject, and body.
   
   ```java
   message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
   message.getTo().add("recipient@example.com");
   message.setSubject("Aspose.Email Tutorial");
   message.setBody("This is an email sent using Aspose.Email for Java.");
   ```

### Create and Add Alternate View to Email Message
#### ملخص
An alternate view allows you to send different content versions of the same message, such as plain text alongside HTML.

#### Steps to Add Alternate Views
1. **Create an AlternateView**

   ```java
   message.getAlternateViews().addItem(alternate);
   ```
