## دليل التنفيذ

### Insert MSG Attachment at a Specific Location

#### ملخص

This feature allows you to insert a new attachment into an existing .MSG file at a specified position. This is particularly useful when the order of attachments matters for presentation or compliance reasons.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Load the Existing MSG File**

Load your MSG file that contains embedded attachments:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/outlook/";
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "WithEmbeddedMsg.msg");
```

**2. Save an Attachment for Demonstration**

Before inserting a new attachment, let's save the first one for demonstration purposes:

```java
msg.getAttachments().get_Item(0).save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "/attachment_out.msg");
```

**3. Load Another MSG File**

Prepare another MSG file that you want to insert as an attachment:

```java
MapiMessage emb = MapiMessage.fromStream(new FileInputStream(dataDir + "WithEmbeddedMsg.msg"));
```

**4. Insert the New Attachment**

Insert this new MSG file at index 1 in your existing attachments collection:

```java
msg.getAttachments().insert(1, "new 11", emb);
```

**5. Save the Modified MSG File**

Finally, save the updated MSG file to your output directory:

```java
msg.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "/insertMSGAttachment_out.msg");
```

### Replace Embedded MSG Attachment Contents

#### ملخص

Replacing an existing attachment ensures that you can update the contents of an email without altering its overall structure.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Load the MSG File with Attachments**

Start by loading the MSG file containing attachments:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/outlook/";
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "insertMSGAttachment_out.msg");
```

**2. Save an Existing Attachment**

For demonstration, save one of the existing attachments:

```java
msg.getAttachments().get_Item(0).save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "/attachment_out.msg");
```

**3. Load a New MSG File for Replacement**

Load another MSG file that will replace the current attachment:

```java
MapiMessage emb = MapiMessage.fromStream(new FileInputStream(dataDir + "insertMSGAttachment_out.msg"));
```

**4. Replace the Attachment**

Replace the attachment at index 1 with this new one:

```java
msg.getAttachments().replace(1, "new 1", emb);
```

**5. Save Changes to the MSG File**

Save your changes to preserve the updated structure:

```java
msg.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + "/replaceEmbeddedMSGAttachment_out.msg");
```
