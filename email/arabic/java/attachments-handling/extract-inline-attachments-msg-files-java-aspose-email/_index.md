## المتطلبات الأساسية

لمتابعة هذا البرنامج التعليمي بشكل فعال، تأكد من أن لديك:
1. **المكتبات والتبعيات:**
   - Aspose.Email for Java version 25.4
   - Maven or any IDE that supports dependency management (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)
2. **متطلبات إعداد البيئة:**
   - JDK 16 installed on your system
3. **المتطلبات المعرفية:**
   - Basic understanding of Java programming
   - Familiarity with handling file I/O in Java

Once you have these prerequisites ready, let's move on to setting up Aspose.Email for Java.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

To begin using Aspose.Email for Java, add it as a dependency in your project. If you're using Maven, this is straightforward:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
  <version>25.4</version>
  <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### خطوات الحصول على الترخيص

To use Aspose.Email, you'll need a valid license:
- **نسخة تجريبية مجانية:** Download the library and try its features for free with some limitations.
- **رخصة مؤقتة:** Obtain a temporary license to test all functionalities without restrictions.
- **شراء:** If satisfied with the trial, purchase a full license for unrestricted use.

### التهيئة الأساسية

To initialize Aspose.Email, ensure your project includes the necessary dependency. Then you can start using its classes and methods to work with email files.

## دليل التنفيذ

In this section, we'll break down the implementation into manageable steps based on features. Each feature will be explained in detail with code snippets for clarity.

### Feature 1: Extract Inline Attachments from MSG File

This feature identifies and extracts inline attachments embedded within an Outlook MSG file using Aspose.Email for Java.

#### Step 1: Load the MSG File

First, load your MSG file into a `MapiMessage` object. This step initializes the message you'll be working with.

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiMessage;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/email/";
MapiMessage message = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "MSG file with RTF Formatting.msg");
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve Attachments

Next, retrieve all attachments from the MSG file using `getAttachments()`.

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiAttachmentCollection;

MapiAttachmentCollection attachments = message.getAttachments();
```

#### Step 3: Check for Inline Attachments

For each attachment, determine if it is inline by leveraging the `IsAttachmentInline` method. This step filters only inline attachments.

```java
for (Object untypedAttachment : attachments) {
    MapiAttachment attachment = (MapiAttachment) untypedAttachment;
    if (IsAttachmentInline(attachment)) {
        try {
            SaveAttachment(attachment, UUID.randomUUID().toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: Determine If Attachment is Inline

This utility function checks whether a given attachment in the MSG file is inline.

#### Implementation Details:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiAttachment;
import com.aspose.email.MapiObjectProperty;
import com.aspose.email.MapiProperty;

static boolean IsAttachmentInline(MapiAttachment attachment) {
    MapiObjectProperty objectData = attachment.getObjectData();
    if (objectData == null) return false;

    for (Object prop : attachment.getObjectData().getProperties().getValues()) {
        MapiProperty property = (MapiProperty) prop;
        if ("\u0003ObjInfo".equals(property.getName())) {
            byte[] data = property.getData();
            int odtPersist1 = data[1] << 8 | data[0];
            return (odtPersist1 & 0x40) == 0;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Feature 3: Save Attachment to File System

This feature saves a specified attachment from an MSG file into your output directory.

#### خطوات التنفيذ:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiAttachment;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

static void SaveAttachment(MapiAttachment attachment, String fileName) throws IOException {
    for (Object prop : attachment.getObjectData().getProperties().getValues()) {
        MapiProperty property = (MapiProperty) prop;
        if ("Package".equals(property.getName())) {
            try (FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream(fileName)) {
                fs.write(property.getData(), 0, property.getData().length);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
