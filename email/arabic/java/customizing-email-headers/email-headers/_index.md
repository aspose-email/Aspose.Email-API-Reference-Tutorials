# Email Headers in Aspose.Email


## Introduction to Email Headers

Email headers are like the envelopes of digital messages. They contain essential metadata that guides an email through its journey from the sender to the recipient. Understanding email headers can help you trace the path an email took, identify potential issues, and ensure secure and reliable email communication.

- From: The sender's email address.
- To: The recipient's email address.
- Subject: The subject of the email.
- Date: The date and time the email was sent.
- Received: A series of entries detailing the email's journey from sender to recipient.
- Message-ID: A unique identifier for the email message.
