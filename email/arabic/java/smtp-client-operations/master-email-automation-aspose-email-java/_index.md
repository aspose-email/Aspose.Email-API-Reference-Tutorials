### الحصول على الترخيص

Aspose.Email for Java offers a free trial and temporary licenses to test its features. For production use, you'll need to purchase a license. Visit the [صفحة الشراء](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more information on acquiring a license.

### التهيئة الأساسية

Initialize your connection with the Exchange server using Aspose.Email's `EWSClient` class as shown below:

```java
private static IEWSClient getAsposeEWSClient() {
    return EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
}
```

## دليل التنفيذ

### Read Inbox Rules

**ملخص:** This feature enables you to connect to an Exchange server and retrieve all existing inbox rules.

#### Step 1: Connect to the Exchange Server
```java
IEWSClient client = getAsposeEWSClient();
InboxRule[] inboxRules = client.getInboxRules();
```

#### Step 2: Iterate and Display Rule Details
For each rule, extract details such as display name, conditions (e.g., from address), and actions (e.g., move to folder).

```java
for (InboxRule inboxRule : inboxRules) {
    System.out.println("Display Name: " + inboxRule.getDisplayName());
    
    if (!inboxRule.getConditions().getFromAddresses().isEmpty()) {
        for (MailAddress fromAddress : inboxRule.getConditions().getFromAddresses()) {
            System.out.println("From: " + fromAddress.getDisplayName() + ": " + fromAddress.getAddress());
        }
    }

    if (!inboxRule.getConditions().containsSubjectStrings().isEmpty()) {
        for (String subject : inboxRule.getConditions().containsSubjectStrings()) {
            System.out.println("Subject contains: " + subject);
        }
    }

    if (!inboxRule.getActions().getMoveToFolder().isEmpty()) {
        System.out.println("Move message to folder: " + inboxRule.getActions().getMoveToFolder());
    }
}
```

### Create a New Inbox Rule

**ملخص:** This feature allows you to define and create new rules on the Exchange server.

#### Step 1: Set Up Conditions
Define conditions like subject strings or sender addresses for your rule.

```java
InboxRule rule = new InboxRule();
rule.setDisplayName("Message from client ABC");

RulePredicates predicates = new RulePredicates();
predicates.containsSubjectStrings().addItem("ABC");
predicates.getFromAddresses().add("administrator@ex2010.local");
rule.setConditions(predicates);
```

#### Step 2: Define Actions
Specify actions such as moving emails to a specific folder when conditions are met.

```java
RuleActions actions = new RuleActions();
actions.setMoveToFolder("120:AAMkADFjMjNjMmNjLWE3NzgtNGIzNC05OGIyLTAwNTgzNjRhN2EzNgAuAAAAAABbwP+Tkhs0TKx1GMf0D/cPAQD2lptUqri0QqRtJVHwOKJDAAACL5KNAAA=AQAAAA==");
rule.setActions(actions);
```

#### Step 3: Create the Rule
Send the rule to the server for creation.

```java
client.createInboxRule(rule);
```

### Update an Existing Inbox Rule

**ملخص:** This feature allows you to modify existing rules, such as updating sender addresses.

#### Step 1: Retrieve and Identify Rules
Fetch all rules and locate the one you wish to update.

```java
InboxRule[] inboxRules = client.getInboxRules();
for (InboxRule inboxRule : inboxRules) {
    if ("Message from client ABC".equals(inboxRule.getDisplayName())) {
        System.out.println("Updating the rule...");
```

#### Step 2: Modify Rule Conditions
Update specific conditions such as changing the sender address.

```java
inboxRule.getConditions().getFromAddresses().set_Item(0, new MailAddress("administrator@ex2010.local", true));
client.updateInboxRule(inboxRule);
    }
}
```
