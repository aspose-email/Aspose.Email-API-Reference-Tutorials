## دليل التنفيذ

### Sending Email via SOCKS Proxy

#### ملخص
Sending emails through a SOCKS proxy can enhance security and allow access from restricted networks. Here's how to configure your SMTP client using Aspose.Email with a SOCKS proxy:

##### Step 1: Set Up the SMTP Client

Start by setting up your SMTP client with necessary credentials and specifying security options.

```java
import com.aspose.email.SmtpClient;
import com.aspose.email.SecurityOptions;
import com.aspose.email.SocksProxy;
import com.aspose.email.SocksVersion;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 587, "username", "aspose1234");
client.setSecurityOptions(SecurityOptions.Auto);
```

##### Step 2: Configure SOCKS Proxy

Define your proxy settings using the SOCKS protocol. Ensure you replace `"proxy.example.com"` with your actual proxy address.

```java
String proxyAddress = "proxy.example.com"; // Replace with actual proxy address.
int proxyPort = 1080; // Standard port for SOCKS proxies.
SocksProxy proxy = new SocksProxy(proxyAddress, proxyPort, SocksVersion.SocksV5);

client.setProxy(proxy);
```

##### الخطوة 3: إرسال البريد الإلكتروني

With your SMTP client configured, you can now send an email through the SOCKS proxy.

```java
client.send(new MailMessage("sender@domain.com", "receiver@domain.com",
        "Sending Email via SOCKS Proxy",
        "Implement socks proxy protocol for versions 4, 4a, 5 (only Username/Password authentication)"));
```

### Sending Email via HTTP Proxy

#### ملخص
HTTP proxies are another way to route your SMTP traffic. They are particularly useful when you need to log or modify requests.

##### Step 1: Set Up the SMTP Client

Just like with SOCKS, start by configuring the SMTP client:

```java
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 587, "username", "aspose1234");
```

##### Step 2: Define HTTP Proxy Settings

Configure your HTTP proxy settings. Replace `"proxy.example.com"` و `8080` with your actual proxy address and port.

```java
import com.aspose.email.HttpProxy;

HttpProxy httpProxy = new HttpProxy("proxy.example.com", 8080);
client.setProxy(httpProxy);
```

##### الخطوة 3: إرسال البريد الإلكتروني

Finally, send an email through the configured HTTP proxy:

```java
client.send(new MailMessage(
    "from@domain.com",
    "to@domain.com",
    "Sending Email via HTTP Proxy",
    "Aspose.Email lets you send emails via Http Proxy."));
```

## التطبيقات العملية

- **Secure Browsing**: Use proxies to securely browse and send emails from within restricted networks.
- **Data Logging**: Employ HTTP proxies for logging email requests in compliance with regulatory standards.
- **بيئات الاختبار**: Simulate different network conditions by routing SMTP traffic through various proxy servers.

These configurations can seamlessly integrate into larger systems requiring robust email communication features, such as CRM platforms or customer service tools.
