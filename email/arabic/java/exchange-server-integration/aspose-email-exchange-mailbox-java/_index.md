public class InitializeAspose {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
    }
}
```

## دليل التنفيذ
### Accessing Mailbox Information
#### ملخص
Retrieve essential details about a mailbox, such as its size and number of messages.

##### Step 1: Create an EWS Client Instance
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMailboxInfo;

public class AccessMailbox {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve Mailbox Information
```java
        ExchangeMailboxInfo mailbox = client.getMailboxInfo();
    }
}
```
**توضيح:** ال `getMailboxInfo()` method fetches the specified mailbox's details, helping you understand its current state.

### Checking Custom Folder Existence
#### ملخص
Determine whether a specific folder exists within an Exchange mailbox to manage emails effectively.

##### Step 1: Initialize EWS Client
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;

public class CheckCustomFolder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
```

##### Step 2: Verify Folder Existence
```java
        ExchangeFolderInfo[] subfolderInfo = new ExchangeFolderInfo[] { null };
        boolean folderExists = client.folderExists("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "592633", subfolderInfo);
    }
}
```
**توضيح:** ال `folderExists()` method checks if the folder with the specified ID exists, helping you avoid errors when accessing non-existent folders.

### Listing Messages from a Folder
#### ملخص
Retrieve all messages within a specific Exchange folder for efficient message management.

##### Step 1: Initialize EWS Client
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;

public class ListMessages {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve Message Collection
```java
        ExchangeFolderInfo[] subfolderInfo = new ExchangeFolderInfo[] { /* previously retrieved folder info */ };
        
        if (subfolderInfo[0] != null) {
            ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages = client.listMessages(subfolderInfo[0].getUri());
        }
    }
}
```
**توضيح:** ال `listMessages()` method gathers all email messages in the specified folder, making it easier to process and manage them.

### Fetching and Displaying Message Details
#### ملخص
Extract detailed information for each message in a folder, such as subject, sender, and body content.

##### Step 1: Initialize EWS Client
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

public class FetchMessageDetails {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve and Display Message Details
```java
        ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages = /* previously retrieved message collection */;
        
        for (ExchangeMessageInfo info : messages) {
            String strMessageURI = info.getUniqueUri();
            MailMessage msg = client.fetchMessage(strMessageURI);
            
            System.out.println("Subject: " + msg.getSubject());
