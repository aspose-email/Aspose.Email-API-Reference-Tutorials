### Filter Messages Using EWS

This section demonstrates how to filter messages based on specific criteria using the EWS API in Java:

#### ملخص
Filtering allows you to retrieve only emails that meet certain conditions, such as a specific subject or date, directly from your mailbox.

```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.MailQuery;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeQueryBuilder;
import java.text.ParseException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;

public class FilterMessagesUsingEWS {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {
        // Establish a connection to the EWS server
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");

        SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss");
        
        // Build a query for emails containing 'Newsletter' in the subject
        ExchangeQueryBuilder builder = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
        builder.getSubject().contains("Newsletter");
        builder.getInternalDate().on(sdf.parse("10/05/2016 10:00:00"));
        MailQuery query = builder.getQuery();

        // Retrieve messages matching the criteria
        ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri(), query, false);
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: The code establishes a connection to your mailbox and creates a query to filter emails with 'Newsletter' in their subject line as of a specific date.

### Filter Messages Based on Today's Date

This feature enables you to fetch emails received on the current day:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;
import java.util.Date;

public class FilterMessagesBasedOnTodayDate {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for today's emails
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getInternalDate().on(new Date());
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This method helps in retrieving only those emails that arrived on the current day, aiding daily email management.

### Filter Messages Based on Date Range

Retrieve messages within a specific date range using this feature:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class FilterMessagesBasedOnDateRange {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for emails received in the last 24 hours
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        Date today = new Date();
        builder.getInternalDate().beforeOrEqual(today);
        builder.getInternalDate().since(new Date(today.getTime() + TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(1)));
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This feature is particularly useful for checking recent communications, allowing you to focus on the most relevant emails.

### Filter Messages Based on Specific Sender

Filter your inbox to show only emails from a specific sender:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;

public class FilterMessagesBasedOnSpecificSender {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for emails from 'saqib.razzaq@127.0.0.1'
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getFrom().contains("saqib.razzaq@127.0.0.1");
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This targeted filtering is excellent for focusing on communications from key contacts or departments.

### Filter Messages Based on Specific Domain

Filter emails originating from a specific domain:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;

public class FilterMessagesBasedOnSpecificDomain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for emails from 'SpecificHost.com'
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getFrom().contains("SpecificHost.com");
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This feature helps in quickly identifying and organizing emails based on their domain origin.

### Filter Messages Based on Specific Recipient

Focus your inbox by filtering messages sent to a specific recipient:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;

public class FilterMessagesBasedOnSpecificRecipient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for emails sent to 'recipient'
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getTo().contains("recipient");
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This can be particularly useful when you're looking to track communications addressed specifically to yourself or another department.

### Combine Queries with AND Logic

Combine multiple conditions using AND logic for a more refined search:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class CombineQueriesWithAND {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a combined query for specific domain, emails received before today,
        // and within the last 7 days
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getFrom().contains("SpecificHost.com");
        builder.getInternalDate().before(new Date());
        builder.getInternalDate().since(new Date(new Date().getTime() + TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(-7)));
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This feature allows for complex queries that can significantly narrow down the emails you need to review.

### Combine Queries with OR Logic

Use OR logic to broaden your search criteria:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailQueryBuilder;

public class CombineQueriesWithOR {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a query for emails either from 'SpecificHost.com' or containing 'Newsletter'
        MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
        builder.getFrom().contains("SpecificHost.com")
                .or(builder.getSubject().contains("Newsletter"));
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: This feature allows you to retrieve emails that meet any of the specified conditions, making it useful for broader searches.
