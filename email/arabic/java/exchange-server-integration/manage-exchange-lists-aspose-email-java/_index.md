```

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

With Maven configured and the library dependency added, you are ready to implement various functionalities using Aspose.Email for Java. Each feature allows seamless interaction with private distribution lists on your Exchange server.

### Create a Private Distribution List
Creating a new list is straightforward:

#### Initialize Client
Connect to your Exchange server:
```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx/", "user", "password", "");
```

#### Create Distribution List
Define the list and its members, then create it on the server:
```java
// Define the distribution list
ExchangeDistributionList distributionList = new ExchangeDistributionList();
distributionList.setDisplayName("test private list");

// Add members to the list
MailAddressCollection members = new MailAddressCollection();
members.add("address1@host.com");
members.add("address2@host.com");
members.add("address3@host.com");

// Create the list on the server
client.createDistributionList(distributionList, members);
```

### Fetch Private Distribution Lists
Retrieve existing lists and their members:

#### List All Distribution Lists
Fetch all private distribution lists from your Exchange server:
```java
ExchangeDistributionList[] distributionLists = client.listDistributionLists();
for (ExchangeDistributionList list : distributionLists) {
    // Fetch each list's members
    MailAddressCollection members = client.fetchDistributionList(list);
}
```

### Add Members to a Private Distribution List
Expanding an existing list with new members is simple:

#### Retrieve and Update the List
First, get current lists, then add new members:
```java
ExchangeDistributionList[] distributionLists = client.listDistributionLists();
MailAddressCollection newMembers = new MailAddressCollection();
newMembers.add("address4@host.com");
newMembers.add("address5@host.com");

// Add to the first list found
client.addToDistributionList(distributionLists[0], newMembers);
```

### Delete Members from a Private Distribution List
Remove specific members as follows:

#### Specify and Remove Members
Identify the members you want to delete and remove them:
```java
ExchangeDistributionList[] distributionLists = client.listDistributionLists();
MailAddressCollection members = client.fetchDistributionList(distributionLists[0]);
MailAddressCollection membersToDelete = new MailAddressCollection();

// Add members to delete
membersToDelete.addItem(members.get_Item(0));
membersToDelete.addItem(members.get_Item(1));

client.deleteFromDistributionList(distributionLists[0], membersToDelete);
```

### Delete a Private Distribution List
To remove an entire list:

#### Delete the Desired List
Select and delete it from your Exchange server:
```java
ExchangeDistributionList[] distributionLists = client.listDistributionLists();
client.deleteDistributionList(distributionLists[0], true);
```
