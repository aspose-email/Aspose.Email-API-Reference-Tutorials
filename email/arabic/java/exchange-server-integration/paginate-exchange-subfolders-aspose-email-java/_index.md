### دليل التنفيذ

#### Feature 1: Establishing EWS Client Connection

**ملخص**: This feature demonstrates setting up a connection to your Exchange server using Aspose.Email for Java, essential for accessing mailboxes and folders.

##### Step-by-Step:

- **تهيئة العميل**

```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class EstablishEwsConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("exchange.domain.com", "username", "password");
        
        try {
            // Use the client for operations
        } finally {
            if (client != null) client.dispose();
        }
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: This snippet creates a connection to your Exchange server using credentials. It's important to dispose of the client after usage to free resources.

#### Feature 2: Paginate Subfolders in Exchange

**ملخص**: Efficiently navigating through subfolders in an Exchange mailbox can be daunting without pagination. We'll break it down into manageable chunks.

##### Step-by-Step:

- **Initialize Pagination**

```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderPageInfo;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PaginateSubFolders {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("exchange.domain.com", "username", "password");
        
        try {
            int itemsPerPage = 5; // Define the number of folders per page
            String rootUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getRootUri();
            
            List<ExchangeFolderPageInfo> pages = new ArrayList<>();
            ExchangeFolderPageInfo pagedFoldersCollection = client.listSubFoldersByPage(rootUri, itemsPerPage);
            pages.add(pagedFoldersCollection);

            while (!pagedFoldersCollection.getLastPage()) {
                pagedFoldersCollection = client.listSubFoldersByPage(
                    rootUri,
                    itemsPerPage,
                    pagedFoldersCollection.getPageOffset() + 1
                );
                pages.add(pagedFoldersCollection);
            }
        } finally {
            if (client != null) client.dispose();
        }
    }
}
```

**توضيح**: This code initializes pagination for subfolders, using a set number of items per page. It retrieves each page until all have been processed.

### التطبيقات العملية
1. **فرز البريد الإلكتروني تلقائيًا**: Use this feature to categorize emails by folder hierarchy.
2. **نقل البيانات**: Efficiently move data between folders during migrations.
3. **Folder Analysis**: Analyze subfolder structures for organizational insights.
