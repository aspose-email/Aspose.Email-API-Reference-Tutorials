## دليل التنفيذ

In this section, we'll guide you through saving Exchange messages as EML and MSG formats.

### Saving Messages as EML Using EWS

This feature allows you to save messages from an Exchange Server mailbox in the widely-used EML format.

#### Step 1: Create Instance of IEWSClient

First, establish a connection to your Exchange server by creating an instance of `IEWSClient` using your credentials:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
    "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx",
    "testUser",
    "pwd",
    "domain"
);
```

#### Step 2: List Messages from Inbox

Next, retrieve the list of messages in your inbox:

```java
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(
    client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri()
);
```

#### Step 3: Iterate and Save Each Message as EML

Finally, loop through each message and save it to disk in EML format:

```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    
    client.saveMessage(
        strMessageURI,
        "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + ".eml"
    );
}
```

### Saving Messages to OutputStream Using EWS

This feature allows you to save messages directly to an output stream, which is useful for streaming data or further processing.

#### Step 1: Create Instance of IEWSClient

As before, start by creating the `IEWSClient` مثال:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
    "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx",
    "testUser",
    "pwd",
    "domain"
);
```

#### Step 2: List Messages from Inbox

Retrieve the messages in your inbox:

```java
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(
    client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri()
);
```

#### Step 3: Iterate and Save Each Message to OutputStream

Loop through each message, creating an output stream for saving it:

```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    
    try {
        OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(
            "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + "_Out.eml"
        );
        
        client.saveMessage(strMessageURI, outputStream);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

### Saving Messages in MSG Format Using EWS

Saving messages in the native MSG format is useful for compatibility with Microsoft Outlook.

#### Step 1: Create Instance of IEWSClient

Establish a connection to your Exchange server:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
    "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx",
    "testUser",
    "pwd",
    "domain"
);
```

#### Step 2: List Messages from Inbox

Retrieve the messages in your inbox:

```java
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(
    client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri()
);
```

#### Step 3: Fetch and Save Each Message as MSG

Fetch each message's details and save it in MSG format:

```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    
    MailMessage msg = client.fetchMessage(strMessageURI);
    
    msg.save(
        "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + ".msg",
        SaveOptions.getDefaultMsg()
    );
}
```

## التطبيقات العملية

Here are some real-world use cases for saving Exchange messages:
1. **أرشفة البريد الإلكتروني**: Preserve important communication records by archiving emails in EML or MSG formats.
2. **نقل البيانات**: Facilitate migration from one email system to another by exporting messages to compatible formats.
3. **الامتثال القانوني**: Ensure compliance with legal requirements by maintaining a secure archive of all correspondence.
