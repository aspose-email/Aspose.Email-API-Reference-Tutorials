### دليل التنفيذ
Let’s break down each feature into detailed steps.

#### Connecting to Exchange Web Service (EWS)
**ملخص**: Establishing a connection to EWS is your first step in leveraging Aspose.Email for Java's capabilities. This allows you to perform various operations on your mailbox, such as reading messages or sending emails.

##### الخطوة 1: إنشاء مثيل لـ IEWSClient
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class ConnectToExchange {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance to connect to the EWS server.
        // Parameters: URL, username, password.
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "");
    }
}
```

- **حدود**:
  - `URL`: The endpoint for your Exchange service.
  - `username` و `password`:بيانات الاعتماد للمصادقة.

#### Adding Custom Headers to EWS Requests
**ملخص**: Custom headers can be crucial for adding metadata or controlling aspects of the requests you send to an EWS server, enhancing functionality such as message anchoring.

##### Step 2: Add a Custom Header
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class AddCustomHeaders {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Connect to the EWS server.
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "");
        
        // Add a custom header for enhanced request handling.
        client.addHeader("X-AnchorMailbox", "username@domain.com");
    }
}
```

- **تكوين المفتاح**: ال `X-AnchorMailbox` header helps in scenarios where the mailbox's state needs to be preserved across operations.

#### Listing Messages in EWS Inbox

##### Step 3: Retrieve and List Messages
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class ListInboxMessages {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Establish a connection to the EWS server.
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "");
        
        // Get the inbox URI from mailbox information.
        String inboxUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri();
        
        // List all messages in the inbox.
        ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol = client.listMessages(inboxUri);
    }
}
