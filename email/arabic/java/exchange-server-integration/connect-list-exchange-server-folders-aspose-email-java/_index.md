### التهيئة والإعداد الأساسي
Once the library is included in your project, initialize it as follows:

```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("YOUR_EXCHANGE_SERVER_URI", "username", "password", "domain");
```

## دليل التنفيذ
Now that the setup is complete, let's delve into the implementation details for connecting and listing folders in your Exchange server.

### Connecting to an Exchange Server
**ملخص:**
Connecting to an Exchange server allows you to perform various operations programmatically. This section demonstrates how to establish a connection using Aspose.Email Java.

#### Step 1: Initialize EWSClient
Create and initialize the `IEWSClient` instance with necessary credentials:

```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class ConnectToExchangeServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("YOUR_EXCHANGE_SERVER_URI", "username", "password", "domain");

            // Retrieve and print the mailbox information.
            String mailboxUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getMailboxUri();
            System.out.println("Connected to Mailbox: " + mailboxUri);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**المعلمات موضحة:**
- `YOUR_EXCHANGE_SERVER_URI`:عنوان URI الخاص بخادم Exchange الخاص بك.
- `username`، `password`، `domain`:بيانات الاعتماد للمصادقة على الاتصال.

### Listing All Folders in Exchange Server
**ملخص:**
Once connected, you can list all folders within the root directory of the mailbox. This is useful for understanding the folder structure and accessing specific data.

#### Step 2: List Top-Level Folders
يستخدم `listSubFolders` to retrieve top-level folders:

```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class ListAllFolders {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("YOUR_EXCHANGE_SERVER_URI", "username", "password", "domain");
            
            // Get the root URI of the mailbox.
            String rootUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getRootUri();

            // List all folders starting from the root URI.
            ExchangeFolderInfoCollection folderInfoCollection = client.listSubFolders(rootUri);
            for (ExchangeFolderInfo folderInfo : folderInfoCollection) {
                System.out.println("Folder: " + folderInfo.getDisplayName());
            }
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**خيارات تكوين المفاتيح:**
- تأكد من `rootUri` correctly points to your mailbox root directory.

### Listing Sub-Folders Recursively
**ملخص:**
This feature extends our ability by recursively listing all sub-folders within a specified parent folder, providing a comprehensive view of the entire folder hierarchy.

#### Step 3: Recursive Listing
Implement recursive logic to traverse through all sub-folders:

```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

public class ListSubFoldersRecursively {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("YOUR_EXCHANGE_SERVER_URI", "username", "password", "domain");

            String rootUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getRootUri();
            ExchangeFolderInfoCollection folderInfoCollection = client.listSubFolders(rootUri);
            
            for (ExchangeFolderInfo folderInfo : folderInfoCollection) {
                listSubFolders(client, folderInfo);
            }
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void listSubFolders(IEWSClient client, ExchangeFolderInfo folderInfo) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Folder: " + folderInfo.getDisplayName());
            
            ExchangeFolderInfoCollection subfolderInfoCollection = client.listSubFolders(folderInfo.getUri());
            for (ExchangeFolderInfo subfolderInfo : subfolderInfoCollection) {
                listSubFolders(client, subfolderInfo);
            }
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**نصائح استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها:**
- Ensure your URI and credentials are accurate.
- Handle exceptions to manage connectivity issues gracefully.

## التطبيقات العملية
The ability to connect and navigate folders in an Exchange server can be applied in various scenarios:
