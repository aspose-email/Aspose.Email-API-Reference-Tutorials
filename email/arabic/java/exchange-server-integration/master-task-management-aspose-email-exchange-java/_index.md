### متطلبات المعرفة
Familiarity with Java programming is recommended to follow this tutorial effectively. Basic understanding of working with APIs will also be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

Aspose.Email for Java provides a robust set of functionalities for email communication. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **تثبيت**: The Maven dependency above should handle the installation of Aspose.Email in your project.
2. **الحصول على الترخيص**: Obtain a temporary license or purchase a full one to unlock all features without limitations. Visit [موقع Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) لمزيد من التفاصيل حول الحصول على التراخيص.

Once you have everything set up, let’s move on to implementing specific functionalities using Aspose.Email Java.

## دليل التنفيذ

### Create Exchange Client Instance

#### ملخص
إنشاء مثيل لـ `ExchangeClient` class is essential to connect and interact with your Microsoft Exchange server. This connection enables you to perform various operations like retrieving tasks or setting time zones.

#### خطوات التنفيذ

##### الخطوة 1: تحديد بيانات الاعتماد
Define the necessary credentials to access your Exchange server:

```java
String serverUrl = "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx";
String username = "testUser";
String password = "pwd";
String domain = "domain";
```

##### Step 2: Establish Connection
Use these credentials to create an instance of the `IEWSClient` فصل:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(serverUrl, username, password, domain);
```

This step initializes your connection with the Exchange server, allowing further operations.

### Set Timezone for Tasks

#### ملخص
Setting a specific time zone ensures that tasks are managed accurately based on the local time of users. This feature is particularly useful in global teams working across different time zones.

#### خطوات التنفيذ

##### الخطوة 1: إنشاء مثيل لـ IEWSClient
Assuming you've already created an `IEWSClient` instance, proceed with setting the timezone:

```java
client.setTimezoneId("Central Europe Standard Time");
```

This step configures your Exchange tasks to align with the specified time zone.

### Retrieve Tasks with Specific Statuses

#### ملخص
Retrieving tasks based on their status helps in filtering and managing them efficiently. This functionality is vital for tracking task progress within a team.

#### خطوات التنفيذ

##### Step 1: Define Task Statuses
Identify which statuses you want to filter:

```java
Integer[] statuses = new Integer[]{
    ExchangeTaskStatus.Completed,
    ExchangeTaskStatus.Deferred,
    ExchangeTaskStatus.InProgress,
    ExchangeTaskStatus.NotStarted,
    ExchangeTaskStatus.WaitingOnOthers
};
```

##### Step 2: Query and Filter Tasks
Construct a query to filter tasks based on the defined statuses:

```java
for (int status : statuses) {
    ExchangeQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
    queryBuilder.getTaskStatus().equals(status);
    MailQuery query = queryBuilder.getQuery();
    
    // Retrieve filtered tasks
    ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getTasksUri(), query);

    if (!messageInfoCol.isEmpty()) {
        ExchangeTask fetchedTask = client.fetchTask(messageInfoCol.get_Item(0).getUniqueUri());
    }
}
```

This implementation allows you to efficiently retrieve tasks matching specific criteria.

### Retrieve Tasks with Multiple Criteria

#### ملخص
Combining multiple conditions in your task retrieval logic can yield more precise results. This capability is essential for complex workflows requiring detailed filtering.

#### خطوات التنفيذ

##### Step 1: Define Multiple Statuses
Set the criteria based on various statuses:

```java
Integer[] selectedStatuses = new Integer[]{
    ExchangeTaskStatus.Completed,
    ExchangeTaskStatus.InProgress
};
```

##### Step 2: Construct Queries for Filtering
Use these conditions to construct your queries:

```java
ExchangeQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
queryBuilder.getTaskStatus().in(Arrays.asList(selectedStatuses));
MailQuery query = queryBuilder.getQuery();

// Retrieve tasks matching any specified statuses
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getTasksUri(), query);
```

Implementing these queries allows for comprehensive task management based on complex conditions.

## التطبيقات العملية

فيما يلي بعض حالات الاستخدام الواقعية حيث يمكن تطبيق هذه الوظائف:
1. **إدارة المشاريع**: Automate the retrieval and organization of tasks within project timelines.
2. **Remote Team Coordination**: Set time zones to ensure all team members, regardless of location, have synchronized task schedules.
3. **Progress Tracking**: Use status-based filtering to generate reports on task completion rates and pending assignments.
