- **شراء**: For continued use, purchase a license via the Aspose purchase portal.

#### التهيئة الأساسية
Once you've set up your Maven project and acquired a license, initialize Aspose.Email in your Java application:
```java
import com.aspose.email.License;

License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
```

## دليل التنفيذ
We will break down the implementation into manageable sections based on key features of connecting and listing messages from an Exchange server.

### الاتصال بخادم Exchange
#### ملخص
This section demonstrates establishing a connection with the Microsoft Exchange Server using Aspose.Email for Java, providing seamless integration capabilities for your applications.
##### الخطوة 1: إنشاء الاتصال
Use the following method to connect to the server:
```java
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

IEWSClient connectToExchangeServer(String exchangeUrl, String username, String password, String domain) {
    // Create instance of IEWSClient class by providing credentials
    return EWSClient.getEWSClient(exchangeUrl, username, password, domain);
}
```
- **حدود**:
  - `exchangeUrl`: URL of the Exchange server.
  - `username`، `password`:بيانات الاعتماد للمصادقة.
  - `domain`: Domain of your organization.

### List Public Folders
#### ملخص
After establishing a connection, you can list all public folders available on the Exchange Server. This feature is essential for applications that need to manage or interact with email data organized in folders.
##### Step 2: Retrieve Folder Information
Use this method to list public folders:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

ExchangeFolderInfoCollection listPublicFolders(IEWSClient client) {
    // List all public folders and return their information as a collection
    return client.listPublicFolders();
}
```
### Display Folder Information
#### ملخص
Displaying folder names and the number of subfolders helps in understanding the structure of your email data.
##### Step 3: Show Folder Details
Implement this method to print folder information:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;

void displayFolderInfo(ExchangeFolderInfo folder) {
    // Print folder details
    System.out.println("Name: " + folder.getDisplayName());
    System.out.println("Subfolders count: " + folder.getChildFolderCount());
}
```
### List Messages from a Folder
#### ملخص
To access email messages, you need to list them within specific folders. This feature is crucial for applications that process or archive emails.
##### Step 4: Fetch Messages
List all messages in a specified public folder:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

ExchangeMessageInfoCollection listMessagesFromFolder(IEWSClient client, ExchangeFolderInfo folder) {
    // List messages from the specified public folder and return their information as a collection
    return client.listMessagesFromPublicFolder(folder);
}
```
### Fetch and Save Messages
#### ملخص
Once you have listed all messages, fetch each one for further processing or saving them locally.
##### Step 5: Retrieve and Store Messages
Here's how to fetch and save emails:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfo;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
import com.aspose.email.SaveOptions;

void fetchAndSaveMessages(IEWSClient client, ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages) {
    for (ExchangeMessageInfo messageInfo : messages) {
        // Fetch the full MailMessage using its unique URI
        MailMessage msg = client.fetchMessage(messageInfo.getUniqueUri());
        
        // Save the fetched message to a file named after its subject with .msg extension
        String filePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + msg.getSubject() + ".msg";
        msg.save(filePath, SaveOptions.getDefaultMsgUnicode());
    }
}
```
### Recursively List Messages from Subfolders
#### ملخص
To ensure comprehensive email management, recursively listing messages in subfolders is necessary.
##### Step 6: Recursive Listing Implementation
Recursively process folders and their subfolders:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

void listMessagesFromSubFolders(IEWSClient client, ExchangeFolderInfo folder) {
    // List all messages in the current public folder
    ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessagesFromPublicFolder(folder);
    fetchAndSaveMessages(client, msgCollection);

    if (folder.getChildFolderCount() > 0) {
        ExchangeFolderInfoCollection subFolders = client.listSubFolders(folder);
        for (ExchangeFolderInfo subFolder : subFolders) {
            listMessagesFromSubFolders(client, subFolder);
        }
    }
}
```
