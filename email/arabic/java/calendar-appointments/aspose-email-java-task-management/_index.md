Ready to enhance your task management workflow? Let's start by looking at the prerequisites.

## المتطلبات الأساسية

قبل أن تبدأ، تأكد من أن لديك:

### المكتبات والتبعيات المطلوبة
- **Aspose.Email for Java**: Version 25.4 or later is needed.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Use version 16 or later.

### متطلبات إعداد البيئة
- A functioning Java development environment with Maven installed.

### متطلبات المعرفة
- Basic understanding of Java and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

To integrate the Aspose.Email library into your project, add this dependency to your `pom.xml` if you're using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### خطوات الحصول على الترخيص

1. **نسخة تجريبية مجانية**: Begin with a free trial to explore features.
2. **رخصة مؤقتة**: Apply for an extended testing license if needed.
3. **شراء**: Consider buying a full license after evaluating the library.

With your environment set up and a license in hand, initialize the library as follows:

```java
String mailboxUri = "https://ex2010/exchangeews/exchange.asmx";
String username = "test.exchange";
String password = "pwd";
String domain = "ex2010.local";

NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(mailboxUri, credentials);
```

This snippet sets up the Exchange Client with your specified credentials.

## دليل التنفيذ

### Initialize Exchange Client

#### ملخص
Initialize the Aspose.Email Java client to connect and authenticate with your Exchange Server. This is essential for accessing mailbox tasks programmatically.

```java
String mailboxUri = "https://ex2010/exchangeews/exchange.asmx";
String username = "test.exchange";
String password = "pwd";
String domain = "ex2010.local";

NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(mailboxUri, credentials);
```

- **حدود**:
  - `mailboxUri`: The endpoint URL of your Exchange server.
  - `username`، `password`، `domain`:بيانات الاعتماد للمصادقة.

### List All Tasks from Exchange Server

#### ملخص
Retrieve all tasks stored in your Exchange mailbox using the initialized client.

```java
client.setTimezoneId("Central Europe Standard Time");
TaskCollection taskCollection = client.listTasks(client.getMailboxInfo().getTasksUri());
int iTasksCount = taskCollection.size();
for (int i = 0; i < iTasksCount; i++) {
    ExchangeTask task = (ExchangeTask) taskCollection.get_Item(i);
    // Process each task
}
```

- **حدود**:
  - `setTimezoneId`: Ensures tasks are displayed in the correct local time.

### Query and List Specific Tasks from Exchange Server

#### ملخص
Filter and list specific tasks based on their status using query capabilities.

```java
Integer[] selectedStatuses = new Integer[]{
        ExchangeTaskStatus.Completed,
        ExchangeTaskStatus.InProgress
};

ExchangeQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
queryBuilder.getTaskStatus().in(Arrays.asList(selectedStatuses));
MailQuery query = queryBuilder.getQuery();

taskCollection = client.listTasks(client.getMailboxInfo().getTasksUri(), query);
iTasksCount = taskCollection.size();
for (int i = 0; i < iTasksCount; i++) {
    ExchangeTask task = (ExchangeTask) taskCollection.get_Item(i);
    // Process each queried task
}
```

- **حدود**:
  - `selectedStatuses`: An array specifying which statuses to filter tasks by.
