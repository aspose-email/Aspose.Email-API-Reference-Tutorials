# Create & Send Calendar Invitations with Aspose.Email for Java: A Step-by-Step Guide
## مقدمة
Managing calendar sharing invitations can be a complex task, especially when dealing with multiple users across different platforms. Aspose.Email for Java provides an efficient way to handle these tasks seamlessly within your applications. This tutorial will guide you through creating and sending calendar sharing invitations using Aspose.Email for Java, making it easier for you to manage delegate access and permissions.

**ما سوف تتعلمه:**
- How to initialize the EWS client with Aspose.Email for Java
- Creating a delegate user and setting calendar folder permissions
- Sending calendar sharing invitations via email
- التطبيقات العملية لهذه الميزات في سيناريوهات العالم الحقيقي

Before we dive into the implementation, let’s cover the prerequisites you need to get started.
## المتطلبات الأساسية
لمتابعة هذا البرنامج التعليمي بشكل فعال، تأكد من أن لديك:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 16 or later.
- **Maven:** For managing project dependencies and building your Java application.
- **Aspose.Email for Java Library:** Specifically version 25.4 with JDK 16 support.
### متطلبات إعداد البيئة
Ensure that your development environment is set up correctly:
1. Install JDK if you haven't already. You can download it from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Make sure Maven is installed and configured on your machine.
3. Set up an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for ease of development.
### متطلبات المعرفة
- Basic understanding of Java programming
- Familiarity with handling dependencies using Maven
- Experience with Exchange Web Services (EWS) can be beneficial but not mandatory
## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
To begin, you'll need to set up your project with the necessary dependencies. We will use Maven for this purpose.
### Maven Configuration
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```
### الحصول على الترخيص
Aspose.Email for Java requires a license to unlock its full potential. Here’s how you can get started:
- **نسخة تجريبية مجانية:** You can download a trial version from [صفحة إصدار Aspose](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).
- **رخصة مؤقتة:** If you need more time, apply for a temporary license on the Aspose website.
- **شراء:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a full license.
### التهيئة والإعداد الأساسي
Once your project is set up with Maven, initialize the EWS client as shown below:
```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
```
## دليل التنفيذ
This section will guide you through two main features: creating and sending calendar sharing invitations, and setting delegate calendar access permissions.
### Feature 1: Create and Send Calendar Sharing Invitation
#### ملخص
Creating a calendar sharing invitation involves initializing the EWS client, configuring delegate permissions, and sending an email invitation.
#### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة
##### تهيئة عميل EWS
First, set up your connection to Exchange Online using the `IEWSClient`:
```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
```
This snippet connects you to the Outlook service, allowing further operations on calendar and emails.
##### Create Delegate User
Next, create a delegate user with specific folder permissions:
```java
ExchangeDelegateUser delegateUser = new ExchangeDelegateUser("sharingfrom@domain.com", ExchangeDelegateFolderPermissionLevel.NotSpecified);
delegateUser.getFolderPermissions().setCalendarFolderPermissionLevel(ExchangeDelegateFolderPermissionLevel.Reviewer);
client.delegateAccess(delegateUser, "sharingfrom@domain.com");
```
This code assigns the `Reviewer` permission level to your delegate user, granting them access to view calendar details.
##### Send Calendar Sharing Invitation
Finally, create and send the invitation:
```java
MapiMessage mapiMessage = client.createCalendarSharingInvitationMessage("sharingfrom@domain.com");

MailConversionOptions options = new MailConversionOptions();
options.setConvertAsTnef(true);

MailMessage mail = mapiMessage.toMailMessage(options);
client.send(mail);
```
This converts the `MapiMessage` to a format suitable for sending as an email and dispatches it using the EWS client.
### Feature 2: Delegate Calendar Access Permission
#### ملخص
Setting delegate permissions involves initializing your client, creating a delegate user, and assigning appropriate permission levels.
#### خطوات التنفيذ
##### تهيئة عميل EWS
Reuse the initialization step from above to connect to Exchange Online:
```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
```
##### Create and Set Delegate Permissions
Create a delegate user and set the permission level:
```java
ExchangeDelegateUser delegateUser = new ExchangeDelegateUser("sharingfrom@domain.com", ExchangeDelegateFolderPermissionLevel.NotSpecified);
delegateUser.getFolderPermissions().setCalendarFolderPermissionLevel(ExchangeDelegateFolderPermissionLevel.Reviewer);

client.delegateAccess(delegateUser, "sharingfrom@domain.com");
```
This code snippet ensures your delegate has `Reviewer` access to the calendar.
## التطبيقات العملية
فيما يلي بعض حالات الاستخدام الواقعية لهذه الميزات:
1. **Corporate Meetings:** Enable team members to view and manage meeting schedules without full access.
2. **إدارة المشاريع:** Allow project leads to monitor timelines while delegating specific tasks.
3. **تخطيط الحدث:** Event coordinators can share calendars with vendors to coordinate logistics.
These integrations help streamline workflows across various organizational needs.
