## دليل التنفيذ
This section walks you through creating and managing calendar events with Aspose.Email for Java. We'll break down the process into manageable steps.

### Feature 1: Create and Configure Calendar Event

#### ملخص
Creating a MAPI calendar appointment involves setting up start and end times, along with details like location, subject, and description.

##### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة

**Set Start and End Dates**

Start by defining the event's start and end dates:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiCalendar;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

public MapiCalendar createAppointment() {
    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
    
    // Setting the start date
    cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2023);
    cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.OCTOBER);
    cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
    Date startDate = cal.getTime();
    
    // Setting the end date
    cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 10);
    Date endDate = cal.getTime();
    
    return new MapiCalendar("Conference Room", "Important Meeting",
        "Discuss project milestones and updates.", startDate, endDate);
}
```

**توضيح**: This code snippet creates a `MapiCalendar` instance with specified start and end dates. The parameters include the location, subject, and description of the event.

### Feature 2: Add Attendees to Meeting

#### ملخص
Adding attendees is essential for ensuring everyone receives notifications and can participate in the event.

**Initialize Recipient Collection**

To manage meeting attendees, initialize a `MapiRecipientCollection`:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiCalendar;
import com.aspose.email.MapiRecipientCollection;
import com.aspose.email.MapiRecipientType;
import java.util.Date;

public MapiCalendar createMeetingWithAttendees(Date startDate, Date endDate) {
    MapiRecipientCollection attendees = new MapiRecipientCollection();
    
    // Adding primary recipients
    attendees.add("attendee1@example.com", "John Doe", MapiRecipientType.MAPI_TO);
    attendees.add("attendee2@example.com", "Jane Smith", MapiRecipientType.MAPI_TO);
    
    return new MapiCalendar(
        "Main Office Boardroom",
        "Team Meeting",
        "Discuss quarterly goals.",
        startDate,
        endDate,
        "organizer@example.com",
        attendees
    );
}
```

**توضيح**: This code sets up a list of primary recipients by specifying their email addresses and display names, ensuring they are notified about the event.

### Feature 3: Create and Save to PST File

#### ملخص
Saving calendar events into a PST file allows for easy sharing and integration with other systems.

##### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة

**Create PST and Add Events**

Here's how you can create a PST file and add your events:

```java
import com.aspose.email.FileFormatVersion;
import com.aspose.email.FolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
import com.aspose.email.StandardIpmFolder;

public void createPSTWithCalendarEvents() {
    String pstFilePath = "/path/to/output/MapiCalendarToPST_out.pst";
    
    PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.create(pstFilePath, FileFormatVersion.Unicode);
    FolderInfo calendarFolder = pst.createPredefinedFolder("Calendar", StandardIpmFolder.Appointments);

    MapiCalendar appointment = createAppointment();
    calendarFolder.addMapiMessageItem(appointment);
    
    Date startDate = new Date(); // Use actual dates from your event
    Date endDate = new Date();
    MapiCalendar meeting = createMeetingWithAttendees(startDate, endDate);
    calendarFolder.addMapiMessageItem(meeting);
}
```

**توضيح**: This snippet demonstrates creating a PST file in Unicode format and adding both an appointment and a meeting to it. It facilitates organized storage of calendar events.
