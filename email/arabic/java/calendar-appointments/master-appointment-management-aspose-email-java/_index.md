Calendar endTime = Calendar.getInstance();
time.setTime(date.get(Calendar.YEAR), date.get(Calendar.MONTH), date.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH), date.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) + 1, 0, 0);

String timeZone = "America/New_York";
MailAddressCollection attendees = new MailAddressCollection();
attendees.addMailAddress(new MailAddress("attendee_address@aspose.com", "Attendee"));
