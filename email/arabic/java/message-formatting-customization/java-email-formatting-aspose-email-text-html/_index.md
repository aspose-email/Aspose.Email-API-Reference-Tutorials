## دليل التنفيذ

### Text Formatting Feature

**ملخص:**
Customize how appointment details are displayed in plain text. Define specific formats for different parts of an appointment, making the output more structured and readable.

#### Step 1: Load Your Appointment Data

Load the appointment data from a `.ics` file:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/email/";
Appointment appointment = Appointment.load(dataDir + "test.ics");
```
This step reads your event details into an `Appointment` object for further processing.

#### Step 2: Set Up Custom Formatting Options

Create and configure `AppointmentFormattingOptions` to specify how each part of the appointment should be displayed:
```java
AppointmentFormattingOptions formattingOptions = new AppointmentFormattingOptions();
formattingOptions.setLocationFormat("Where: {0}");
formattingOptions.setTitleFormat("Subject: {0}");
formattingOptions.setDescriptionFormat("\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n{0}");
```
Here, each format string is a template where `{0}` will be replaced by the actual appointment details.

#### Step 3: Generate and Output Formatted Text

Generate the formatted text representation of your appointment:
```java
String formattedText = appointment.getAppointmentText(formattingOptions);
system.out.println(formattedText);
```
This output can now be used in email bodies or logs where plain text is preferred.

### HTML Formatting Feature

**ملخص:**
Create visually appealing, structured HTML representations of appointments for web pages or emails supporting HTML.

#### Step 1: Load Your Appointment Data

As with the text formatting, start by loading your `.ics` file:
```java
Appointment appointment = Appointment.load(dataDir + "test.ics");
```

#### Step 2: Create HTML Formatting Options

يستخدم `createAsHtml()` to initialize options for HTML output:
```java
AppointmentFormattingOptions formattingOptions = AppointmentFormattingOptions.createAsHtml();
formattingOptions.setLocationFormat("<FONT SIZE=2 FACE=\"Arial\"><b>Where: {0}</b></FONT><BR>");
formattingOptions.setTitleFormat("<FONT SIZE=2 FACE=\"Arial\"><b>Subject: {0}</b></FONT><BR>");
formattingOptions.setDescriptionFormat("<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=\"Arial\">-----------<br><i>{0}</i></FONT></P>");
```
This setup allows for rich text styling using HTML tags to enhance the visual presentation of appointment details.

#### Step 3: Generate and Output Formatted HTML

Create the formatted HTML string:
```java
String formattedHtml = appointment.getAppointmentText(formattingOptions);
system.out.println(formattedHtml);
```
This can be embedded directly into web pages or styled email templates that support HTML content.
