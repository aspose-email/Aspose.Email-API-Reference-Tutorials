## دليل التنفيذ

### Feature Overview: Creating a Poll with MAPI Message

This section walks you through creating and configuring a poll within an email using Aspose.Email's `FollowUpManager` فصل.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories

Define paths for your document and output directories:

```java
String dataDir = YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "outlook/";
```

يستبدل `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual path to your directory.

#### الخطوة 2: إنشاء رسالة اختبار MAPI

Create a test message without setting it as a draft. This serves as our base for adding polling options:

```java
MapiMessage msg = createTestMessage(false);
```

#### Step 3: Initialize FollowUpOptions and Set Voting Buttons

تكوين `FollowUpOptions` لتضمين أزرار التصويت المطلوبة:

```java
FollowUpOptions options = new FollowUpOptions();
options.setVotingButtons("Yes;No;Maybe;Exactly!");
```

This step allows you to specify multiple polling choices.

#### الخطوة 4: تطبيق خيارات المتابعة على الرسالة

Attach the configured follow-up options to your message:

```java
FollowUpManager.setOptions(msg, options);
```

By setting these options, you enable interactive voting within your email.

#### Step 5: Save the Enhanced Email Message

Finally, save the MAPI message with polling capabilities:

```java
msg.save(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "MapiMsgWithPoll_out.msg");
```

This step ensures that your poll is embedded in a file ready for distribution or testing.

### Helper Method to Create a Test MAPI Message

Here's how you can create a basic test message, which will be enhanced with polling options:

```java
private static MapiMessage createTestMessage(boolean draft) {
    return new MapiMessage("from@test.com", "to@test.com",
                           "Polling Feature in Aspose.Email", "This is a test message.");
