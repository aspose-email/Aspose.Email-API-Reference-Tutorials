## دليل التنفيذ

We'll break down the process of crafting an email into manageable steps. Each section highlights key features and configurations essential for effective email management.

### Creating a New MailMessage Instance

To create an email, start by initializing a `MailMessage` هدف:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailAddress;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

// إنشاء مثيل جديد لـ MailMessage
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

This step lays the foundation for building your email.

### Setting the Sender's Email Address

Define who is sending the email by setting the sender's address:

```java
message.setFrom(new MailAddress("sender@gmail.com"));
```
*Why it matters:* Ensures emails are sent from a valid, authenticated source.

### Adding Recipients

Add one or more recipients to whom the email will be delivered:

```java
message.getTo().add("receiver@gmail.com");
```

### Specifying the Subject

Set a concise and descriptive subject for your email:

```java
message.setSubject("Using MailMessage Features");
```
*Why it matters:* The subject line is critical as it often determines whether an email gets opened.

### Setting Date, Priority, and Sensitivity

Assign the sending date, define priority level, and set sensitivity settings to tailor how recipients perceive your message:

```java
message.setDate(new java.util.Date());
message.setPriority(com.aspose.email.MailPriority.High);
message.setSensitivity(com.aspose.email.MailSensitivity.Normal);
```

### تكوين إشعارات التسليم

Ensure you receive a notification when the email is successfully delivered:

```java
message.setDeliveryNotificationOptions(com.aspose.email.DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnSuccess);
```
*Why it matters:* Helps in tracking delivery status, crucial for important communications.

### حفظ الرسالة

Finally, save your message to an EML file, which can be opened by most email clients:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
message.save(dataDir + "UseMailMessageFeatures_out.eml");
```
*Why it matters:* Allows you to store and retrieve emails programmatically for record-keeping or further processing.
