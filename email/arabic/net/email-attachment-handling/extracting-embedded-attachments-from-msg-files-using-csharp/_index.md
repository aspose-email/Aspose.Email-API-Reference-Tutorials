# Extracting Embedded Attachments from MSG Files using C#


## Introduction to Embedded Attachments

## Loading and Parsing MSG Files

Before extracting embedded attachments, we need to load and parse the MSG file using Aspose.Email. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;

// Load MSG file
using (var message = MailMessage.Load("sample.msg"))
{
    // Access message properties
    string subject = message.Subject;
    string sender = message.From.Address;
    // ...
}
```

## Extracting Embedded Attachments

Now that we have loaded the MSG file, let's extract the embedded attachments:

```csharp
// Extract embedded attachments
foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    if (attachment.IsEmbeddedMessage)
    {
        var embeddedMsg = (MailMessage)attachment.Object;
        // Process the embedded message
    }
}
```

## Saving Extracted Attachments

Once we've processed the embedded attachments, we can save them to the desired location:

```csharp
// Save embedded attachments
foreach (var attachment in embeddedMsg.Attachments)
{
    attachment.Save("path/to/save/" + attachment.Name);
}
```
