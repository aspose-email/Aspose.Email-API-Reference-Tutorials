# Adding New TNEF Attachments in C#


## Introduction to TNEF Attachments and Aspose.Email for .NET

TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) attachments are a proprietary format used by Microsoft Outlook to package rich text and attachments within emails. Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to work with emails in various formats, including TNEF attachments, using C#.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into coding, make sure you have a development environment set up. Install Visual Studio and create a new C# project.

## Creating a New Project

Start by creating a new C# project in Visual Studio. Choose a suitable project name and location.

## Adding the Aspose.Email for .NET Library

To work with emails and TNEF attachments, we need to add the Aspose.Email for .NET library to our project. You can do this by using NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the appropriate package.

## Loading an Existing Email with TNEF Attachment

To begin, let's load an existing email that contains a TNEF attachment. You'll need to provide the path to the email file.

```csharp


// Load the email with TNEF attachment
MsgLoadOptions options = new MsgLoadOptions();
options.PreserveTnefAttachments = true;
var message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/email.eml", options);
```

## Extracting and Modifying TNEF Attachments

Once you have the email loaded, you can extract the TNEF attachment and modify it as needed.

```csharp
// Iterate through attachments
foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "application/ms-tnef")
    {
        // Extract TNEF attachment
        var tnefAttachment = attachment;

        // Access TNEF properties and modify if necessary
        // tnefAttachment.Properties...
    }
}
```

## Saving the Email with Modified Attachments

After modifying the TNEF attachment, you can save the email back to a file.

```csharp
// Save the modified email
EmlSaveOptions emlSaveOptions = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.EmlFormat);
emlSaveOptions.FileCompatibilityMode = FileCompatibilityMode.PreserveTnefAttachments;
message.Save("path/to/modified_email.eml", emlSaveOptions);
```
