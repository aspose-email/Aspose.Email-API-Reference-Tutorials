# Extracting Embedded Objects - C# Tutorial


## Introduction to Extracting Embedded Objects - C# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to extract embedded objects from email messages using the Aspose.Email for .NET library. Aspose.Email is a powerful and versatile library that enables developers to work with email messages, attachments, and various other aspects of email communication within their .NET applications.

## Prerequisites:

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of C# programming and the .NET framework. Additionally, make sure you have Visual Studio or another suitable development environment set up on your machine.

## Installing Aspose.Email for .NET:

To get started, you need to install the Aspose.Email for .NET library. You can do this using NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. Open your project, right-click on the project name in the Solution Explorer, and select "Manage NuGet Packages." Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

## Loading Email Messages:

Before we can extract embedded objects, we need to load email messages into our application. Aspose.Email provides classes and methods to efficiently load and manipulate email messages in various formats such as EML, MSG, and PST.

```csharp
// Load an email message from a file
var message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/email.eml");
```

## Extracting Embedded Objects from Email Messages:

Once we have the email message loaded, we can proceed to extract embedded objects, such as images and attachments, from the message. Aspose.Email offers methods to access the attachments and embedded images within the message.

```csharp
foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    // Extract and process the attachment
}

foreach (var embeddedImage in message.LinkedResources)
{
    // Extract and process the embedded image
}
```

## Saving Extracted Objects:

After extracting the embedded objects, you might want to save them to a specific location on your system. Aspose.Email provides methods to save the extracted objects, allowing you to organize and manage the extracted content.

```csharp
foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    attachment.Save("path/to/save/" + attachment.Name);
}

foreach (var embeddedImage in message.LinkedResources)
{
    embeddedImage.Save("path/to/save/" + embeddedImage.ContentId);
}
```

## Handling Different Types of Embedded Objects:

Email messages can contain a variety of embedded objects, including images, audio files, and documents. Aspose.Email enables you to identify the type of embedded object and process it accordingly.

```csharp
foreach (var attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "image/jpeg")
    {
        // Process image attachment
    }
    else if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "audio/mpeg")
    {
        // Process audio attachment
    }
    // Add more conditions for different types
}
```
