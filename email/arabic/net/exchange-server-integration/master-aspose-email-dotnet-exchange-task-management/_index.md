### Feature 1: Connect to Exchange Web Service

#### ملخص
Connecting to EWS is crucial as it forms the foundation of all subsequent operations with your Exchange tasks. This feature demonstrates how to establish a secure connection using your credentials.

##### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة:

**Establish Connection:**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;

public class ConnectToExchangeService {
    public static void Run() {
        // Create an instance of IEWSClient by providing server URL, username, password, and domain.
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(
            "https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx،
            "testUser",
            "pwd",
            "domain"
        );
    }
}
```
- **حدود**: Server URL, username, password, and domain are required to authenticate.
- **Return Value**: An `IEWSClient` object that allows interaction with the Exchange server.

**Handling Common Issues:**
Ensure correct credentials and network connectivity. Use HTTPS for secure connections.

### Feature 2: List Tasks from Exchange Server

#### ملخص
Once connected, you can list all tasks available in your mailbox, which is essential for task management applications.

##### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة:

**Retrieve Task Collections:**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange;

public class ListExchangeTasks {
    public static void Run(IEWSClient client) {
        // Get all task information collections from the exchange server's Tasks URI.
        ExchangeMessageInfoCollection tasks = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.TasksUri);
    }
}
```
- **حدود**: ال `client` object obtained during connection.
- **Return Value**: A collection of task information.

**نصائح استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها:**
Verify that your mailbox contains tasks, and ensure the correct URI is being used for fetching tasks.

### Feature 3: Parse and Fetch Exchange Task Details

#### ملخص
Parsing through the list to fetch specific details helps in processing individual tasks based on criteria like subject matching.

##### التنفيذ خطوة بخطوة:

**Iterate Through Tasks:**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange;

public class ParseAndFetchTasks {
    public static void Run(IEWSClient client) {
        // Placeholder array to mimic tasks info for demonstration purposes.
        ExchangeMessageInfo[] tasks = new ExchangeMessageInfo[0];

        foreach (ExchangeMessageInfo info in tasks) {
            // Fetch the task from the exchange server using its unique URI identifier.
            ExchangeTask task = client.FetchTask(info.UniqueUri);

            if (task.Subject.Equals("test")) {
                Console.WriteLine($"Task '{task.Subject}' found.");
            }
