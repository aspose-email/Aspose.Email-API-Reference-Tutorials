### Feature 1: Connect to Exchange Web Service
Connecting to the EWS is foundational for accessing mailboxes and distribution lists. Here’s how you can establish a connection:

#### Step 1: Define Credentials and Server URL

```csharp
string url = "https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx";
string username = "testUser";  // استبدله باسم المستخدم الفعلي الخاص بك
string password = "pwd";       // استبدلها بكلمة المرور الفعلية الخاصة بك
string domain = "domain";      // Replace with your actual domain
```

These credentials are necessary for authenticating and accessing the Exchange server securely.

#### Step 2: Create an Instance of IEWSClient

```csharp
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(url, username, password, domain);
```

This step initializes a connection using Aspose’s `EWSClient`, allowing you to interact with the service programmatically.

### Feature 2: List Distribution Lists
Once connected, retrieving distribution lists is straightforward:

#### Step 1: Retrieve Distribution Lists

```csharp
ExchangeDistributionList[] distributionLists = client.ListDistributionLists();
```

This method fetches all available distribution lists from your Exchange server.

#### Optional: Display Lists
For demonstration purposes, you can iterate through the lists:

```csharp
foreach (var list in distributionLists)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Distribution List: " + list.DisplayName);
}
```

### Feature 3: Add Members to a Distribution List
Managing membership is key for keeping communication channels effective.

#### Step 1: Create Collection for New Members

```csharp
MailAddressCollection newMembers = new MailAddressCollection();
newMembers.Add("address4@host.com");
newMembers.Add("address5@host.com");
```

These addresses represent the members you wish to add.

#### Step 2: Add Members to a Specific Distribution List

```csharp
client.AddToDistributionList(client.ListDistributionLists()[listIndex], newMembers);
```

This command updates your chosen list by adding new members, expanding its reach.
