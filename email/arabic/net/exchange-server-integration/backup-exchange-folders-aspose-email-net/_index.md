## دليل التنفيذ

### Feature 1: Create EWS Client and Retrieve Mailbox Info

#### ملخص
إنشاء مثيل لـ `IEWSClient` allows you to connect to your Exchange server using credentials, crucial for operations like retrieving mailbox information.

**الخطوة 1**: Define your server details and credentials.
```csharp
string mailboxUri = "https://ews.domain.com/ews/Exchange.asmx";
string domain = @"";
string username = "username";
string password = "password";

NetworkCredential credential = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(mailboxUri, credential);
```

**الخطوة 2**: Retrieve mailbox information.
```csharp
ExchangeMailboxInfo mailboxInfo = client.GetMailboxInfo();
Console.WriteLine("Mailbox info retrieved successfully.");
```

هنا، `GetMailboxInfo()` returns an object containing details like the email address and storage limits, essential for understanding your mailbox's current state.

### Feature 2: Backup Exchange Folders to PST

#### ملخص
Backing up specific folders from your Exchange server into a PST file ensures data redundancy and easy archival.

**الخطوة 1**: Set up directory paths.
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

**الخطوة 2**: Retrieve the folder you wish to backup.
```csharp
ExchangeFolderInfo info = client.GetFolderInfo(mailboxInfo.InboxUri);
ExchangeFolderInfoCollection fc = new ExchangeFolderInfoCollection();
fc.Add(info);
```

**الخطوة 3**: Perform the backup operation.
```csharp
client.Backup(fc, dataDir + "Backup_out.pst");
```

ال `Backup` method saves your specified folder's contents into a PST file at the defined location.

### نصائح استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها
- **مشاكل المصادقة**: Ensure that the username and password are correct. Verify network connectivity to the Exchange server.
