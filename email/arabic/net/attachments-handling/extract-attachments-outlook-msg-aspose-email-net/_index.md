### Extract Attachments from Outlook MSG File
This feature enables you to extract attachments from an Outlook MSG file and save them locally.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:
**1. Load the MSG File**
First, load the MSG file using the `MapiMessage.FromFile()` طريقة.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;

// Set your document directory path.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
// Specify your MSG file name.
string fileName = "outputAttachments.msg";

// Load the MSG file into a MapiMessage object.
MapiMessage message = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/" + fileName);
```

**2. Extract and Save Attachments**
Iterate through each attachment in the loaded MSG file, saving them to your desired output directory.

```csharp
// Specify your output directory path.
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

foreach (MapiAttachment attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    // Save each attachment using its original filename.
    attachment.Save(outputPath + "/" + attachment.FileName);
}
```

**توضيح:**
- `MapiMessage.FromFile()`: Loads the MSG file into a manageable object.
- `message.Attachments`: Accesses the collection of attachments within the MSG file.
- `attachment.Save()`: Saves each attachment to your specified directory.

### Load and Process Outlook MSG File
Loading an MSG file is just the first step. Here's how you can initialize this process:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;

// Set up paths for data directory and output directory as shown earlier.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string fileName = "outputAttachments.msg";

// Load the MSG into a MapiMessage object as previously demonstrated.
MapiMessage message = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/" + fileName);

// Now, you can process attachments or other parts of the email.
```
