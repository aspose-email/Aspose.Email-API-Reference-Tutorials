```

With your environment ready and Aspose.Email installed, let’s delve into how to implement email attachment categorization.

## دليل التنفيذ
This section walks you through identifying inline and regular attachments using Aspose.Email .NET. We'll break down the process step by step.

### Identify Inline and Regular Attachments
**ملخص:**
The primary goal is to distinguish between inline and regular attachments within an email message, enabling better organization and processing of email content.

#### الخطوة 1: تحديد دليل المستندات الخاص بك
Start by specifying the path where your emails are stored:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/RemoveAttachments.msg";
```
**توضيح**: يستبدل `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual directory path where your email files are located. This setup ensures that the code correctly locates and processes the specified file.

#### الخطوة 2: تحميل رسالة البريد الإلكتروني
Use Aspose.Email to load the message from a file:
```csharp
var message = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir);
```
**توضيح**: `MapiMessage.FromFile` reads an email stored in MSG format, preparing it for attachment processing.

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Attachments
Loop through each attachment and determine its type using the following logic:
```csharp
var attachments = message.Attachments;

for (int i = 0; i < attachments.Count; i++)
{
    var attachment = attachments[i];
    
    if (IsInlineAttachment(attachment, message))
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine($"{attachment.LongFileName} is inline attachment");
    }
}
```
**توضيح**: ال `IsInlineAttachment` method checks whether an attachment should be categorized as inline based on the context within the email body. Inline attachments are usually images or CSS files embedded in HTML emails.

### نصائح استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها
- **مشاكل مسار الملف**: Ensure that your file path is correctly set up and accessible.
- **Attachment Type Misclassification**:تحقق مرة أخرى من `IsInlineAttachment` logic to ensure it aligns with how inline resources are defined in your email format.

## التطبيقات العملية
Understanding how to categorize attachments can enhance various aspects of your workflow. Here are some real-world use cases:

1. **حلول أرشفة البريد الإلكتروني**: Streamline the archiving process by tagging and storing inline attachments differently for faster retrieval.
2. **Automated Email Processing Systems**: Improve data extraction from emails by accurately identifying embedded content.
3. **أدوات دعم العملاء**: Efficiently manage support tickets by categorizing customer-submitted files.
