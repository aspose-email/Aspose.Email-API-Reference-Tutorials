## دليل التنفيذ
We'll break down the tutorial into three main features: adding attachments, removing attachments, and managing remaining attachments.

### Feature 1: Creating and Adding Attachments to an Email Message
#### ملخص
Adding attachments is a common task in email management. This feature demonstrates how you can create a `MailMessage` instance, set its sender and recipient, load attachments from files, and append them to the message.

#### خطوات التنفيذ
**Step 1: Create MailMessage Instance**
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string dstEmailWithAttachments = dataDir + "/EmailWithAttachments.msg";

MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@sender.com";
message.To.Add("receiver@gmail.com");
```

**Step 2: Load and Add Attachments**
```csharp
Attachment attachment1 = new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.txt");
message.Attachments.Add(attachment1);
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.jpg"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.doc"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.rar"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.pdf"));
```

**الخطوة 3: حفظ الرسالة**
```csharp
message.Save(dstEmailWithAttachments, SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
```
This step saves your email with attachments to disk.

### Feature 2: Removing Attachments from an Email Message
#### ملخص
Removing specific attachments is sometimes necessary. This section covers how to achieve that effectively.

#### خطوات التنفيذ
**الخطوة 1: تحميل رسالة البريد الإلكتروني**
```csharp
string dstEmailRemoved = dataDir + "/RemoveAttachments.msg";
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load(dstEmailWithAttachments);
```

**Step 2: Remove a Specific Attachment**
```csharp
message.Attachments.Remove(attachment1); // Removes the first attachment
```

**Step 3: Save the Updated Message**
```csharp
string destinationEmailRemoved = dataDir + "/RemoveAttachments.msg";
message.Save(destinationEmailRemoved, SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
```
This saves the email after removing attachments.

### Feature 3: Listing and Saving Remaining Attachments
#### ملخص
After modifications, you might want to save or list remaining attachments. This feature guides you through this process.

#### خطوات التنفيذ
**Step 1: Load Updated Email Message**
```csharp
string destinationOutputDir = dataDir + "/RemoveAttachments/";
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load(dstEmailRemoved);
```

**Step 2: Save Remaining Attachments**
```csharp
foreach (Attachment getAttachment in message.Attachments)
{
    string outputFilePath = destinationOutputDir + "/attachment_out" + getAttachment.Name;
    getAttachment.Save(outputFilePath); // Saves each attachment to disk
}
```
This step iterates through attachments and saves them individually.
