# Verifying Bounced Messages with C# Code


Are you tired of dealing with bounced email messages? Managing bounced emails can be a real headache, especially when you're running an email campaign or maintaining a large mailing list. Fortunately, there's a solution that can help you efficiently verify and handle bounced messages using C# code and the Aspose.Email for .NET library. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of verifying bounced messages and ensuring that your email communication remains effective and hassle-free.

## Installation and Setup

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure that you have everything set up to get started.

### تثبيت Aspose.Email لـ .NET

Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that simplifies email-related tasks in C# applications. To install it, follow these steps:

1. افتح مشروع Visual Studio الخاص بك.
2. Go to "Tools" > "NuGet Package Manager" > "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution."
3. Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the package.

### Creating a New C# Project

If you don't have a C# project yet, here's how you can create one:

1. افتح Visual Studio.
2. Click on "Create a new project."
3. Select "Console App (.NET Core)" or "Console App (.NET Framework)" depending on your preference.
4. Choose a name and location for your project.

### Adding References and Namespaces

Once you have your project set up, you'll need to add the necessary references and namespaces to start using Aspose.Email:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Imap;

```

## Connecting to the Email Server

To connect to the email server, you'll need to configure the server settings and establish a connection.

```csharp
// Server configuration
string host = "your-email-server.com";
int port = 993;
string username = "your-username";
string password = "your-password";

// Create an instance of the ImapClient
using (ImapClient client = new ImapClient((host, port, username, password))
{
   
    // Your code for retrieving and analyzing bounced messages will go here
}
```

## Retrieving Bounced Messages

Once connected, you can fetch inbox messages and identify bounced emails.

```csharp
// حدد مجلد البريد الوارد
client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);

// Search for bounced messages
MessageInfoCollection messages = client.ListMessages();
foreach (var messageInfo in messages)
{
    // Your code to analyze bounce notifications will go here
}
```

## Analyzing Bounce Notifications

Bounce notifications contain valuable information about why an email bounced. You can extract these details and classify bounce types.

```csharp
// Fetch the message
MailMessage message = client.FetchMessage(messageInfo.UniqueId);

// Check for bounce headers
if (message.Headers.Contains("X-Failed-Recipients"))
{
    string failedRecipients = message.Headers["X-Failed-Recipients"];
    string bounceReason = message.Headers["X-Failure-Reason"];
    
    // Your code to handle different bounce types will go here
}
```

## Updating Your Email List

Based on the bounce analysis, you can update your email list to remove bounced addresses and manage unsubscribes.

```csharp
// Remove bounced addresses from your list
string bouncedAddress = "bounced@example.com";
if (failedRecipients.Contains(bouncedAddress))
{
    // Remove the address from your list
}

// Handle unsubscribes
if (bounceReason.Contains("unsubscribe"))
{
    // Update your unsubscribe list
}
```
