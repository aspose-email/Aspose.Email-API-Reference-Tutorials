## دليل التنفيذ

Let’s dive into creating and saving an Outlook note using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Creating a MAPI Note
First, you’ll create an instance of `MapiNote`. This object serves as the foundation for your note:

```csharp
// Create an instance of MapiNote
MapiNote note3 = new MapiNote();
```

#### Setting Properties
Now, let's set various properties like subject, body, color, and dimensions.

**Subject**: The title or heading of the note.
```csharp
note3.Subject = "Blue Color Note"; // Set the subject
```

**Body**: Main content text of the note.
```csharp
note3.Body = "This is a blue color note"; // Set body text
```

**Color**: Visual customization for easy identification.
```csharp
note3.Color = NoteColor.Blue; // Set color to Blue
```

**Dimensions**: Define the size in pixels.
```csharp
note3.Height = 500; // Set height
note3.Width = 500; // Set width
```

### Saving the Note
Finally, save your note as a `.msg` file for easy access and sharing:

```csharp
// Save the note to a specified output directory
note3.Save(outputDir + "MapiNote_out.msg");
```

## التطبيقات العملية
1. **إدارة المشاريع**: Use customized notes to track tasks and deadlines.
2. **ملخصات الاجتماعات**: Quickly jot down key points during meetings.
