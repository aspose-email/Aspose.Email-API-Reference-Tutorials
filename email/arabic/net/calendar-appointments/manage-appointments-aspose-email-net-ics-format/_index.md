## دليل التنفيذ

This section covers how to create an appointment in ICS format and load it back into your application. Each feature is broken down step-by-step.

### Feature 1: Create Appointment in ICS Format

Creating an appointment involves setting up various details like location, summary, and attendees, then saving this information in a universally accepted ICS format.

#### Step 1: Define the Appointment Details
Start by defining key properties of your appointment such as its location, summary, description, start time, end time, organizer, and attendees. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Create and initialize an instance of the Appointment class
Appointment appointment = new Appointment(
    "Meeting Room 3 at Office Headquarters", // Location
    "Monthly Meeting",                        // Summary
    "Please confirm your availability.",     // Description
    new DateTime(2015, 2, 8, 13, 0, 0),       // تاريخ البدء
    new DateTime(2015, 2, 8, 14, 0, 0),       // تاريخ الانتهاء
    "from@domain.com",                        // Organizer
    "attendees@domain.com");                 // Attendees
```

#### Step 2: Set Additional Properties

You can set additional properties such as created and last modified dates to track when the appointment was made or updated:

```csharp
// Set additional properties of the appointment
appointment.CreatedDate = new DateTime(2018, 9, 15, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
appointment.LastModifiedDate = new DateTime(2018, 9, 16, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
```

#### Step 3: Save the Appointment

Save the appointment in ICS format to a specified directory. This makes it easy to share or store appointments externally:

```csharp
// Set the path for saving the appointment file
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string dstEmail = dataDir + "/test.ics";

// Save the appointment to disk in ICS format
appointment.Save(dstEmail, AppointmentSaveFormat.Ics);
```

### Feature 2: Load Appointment from ICS File

Loading an appointment involves reading the saved ICS file and extracting its details for display or further processing.

#### Step 1: Load the ICS File

استخدم `Appointment.Load` method to read the details of a previously saved appointment:

```csharp
// Set the path for loading the appointment file
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string dstEmail = dataDir + "/test.ics";

// Load an Appointment from a previously saved ICS file
Appointment loadedAppointment = Appointment.Load(dstEmail);
```

#### Step 2: Display Appointment Details

Extract and display various properties of the loaded appointment, such as its summary, location, start date, and attendees:

```csharp
// Display the appointment information on screen (replace with appropriate output in your application)
Console.WriteLine("Summary: " + loadedAppointment.Summary);
Console.WriteLine("Location: " + loadedAppointment.Location);
Console.WriteLine("Description: " + loadedAppointment.Description);
Console.WriteLine("Start date: " + loadedAppointment.StartDate);
Console.WriteLine("End date: " + loadedAppointment.EndDate);
Console.WriteLine("Organizer: " + loadedAppointment.Organizer);
Console.WriteLine("Attendees: " + loadedAppointment.Attendees);
Console.WriteLine("Created Date: " + loadedAppointment.CreatedDate);
Console.WriteLine("Last Modified Date: " + loadedAppointment.LastModifiedDate);
```
