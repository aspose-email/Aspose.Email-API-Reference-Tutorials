**التهيئة الأساسية:**

Once installed, initialize your project with:

```

## دليل التنفيذ

### Adding Attachments to Calendar Events

This feature enables you to enhance calendar events by attaching multiple files, including documents or any other file type.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Environment

Ensure your project has access to the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Calendar;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using System.IO;
```

#### Step 2: Define Document Paths

Set up paths for documents and outputs. This will help organize where attachments are sourced from and stored.

```csharp
string dataDir = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
```

### تفاصيل التنفيذ

**Creating the Event:**

ابدأ بإنشاء مثيل لـ `MapiCalendar`:

```csharp
var appointment = new MapiCalendar("location", "summary", 
                                   "description", DateTime.Now, 
                                   DateTime.Now.AddHours(1));
```
Here, you define the event's location, summary, description, start time, and duration.

**Adding Attachments:**

To add attachments to your event:

```csharp
// Retrieve files from a directory
foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(dataDir))
{
    var attachment = new MapiAttachment(Path.GetFileName(file), File.ReadAllBytes(file));
    appointment.Attachments.Add(attachment);
}
```
This loop iterates through all files in the specified directory, creating an `MapiAttachment` for each and adding it to your event.

### نصائح استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها

- Ensure paths are correctly set; otherwise, file attachment operations may fail.
- Check file permissions if attachments cannot be added.

## التطبيقات العملية

Integrating this feature can enhance various scenarios:
1. **إدارة المشاريع**: Attach project plans directly to deadline reminders.
2. **Meetings and Conferences**: Provide agendas or presentations as event attachments.
3. **Personal Organization**: Keep related documents attached to personal events, like birthdays or anniversaries.

## اعتبارات الأداء

To optimize performance when working with Aspose.Email:
- Minimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly after use.
- Handle large files efficiently by reading and writing in chunks if necessary.
- Profile your application regularly to identify bottlenecks related to email processing.
