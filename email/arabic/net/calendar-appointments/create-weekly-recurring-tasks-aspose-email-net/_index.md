## دليل التنفيذ

This section covers two main features: creating a weekly recurring task and calculating occurrences.

### Feature 1: Weekly Task Creation with Recurrence

**ملخص:**
Learn how to create a MapiTask that repeats weekly using Aspose.Email's `MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern`, automating task creation without manual intervention for each occurrence.

#### Step 1: Define Dates and Adjust for Time Zone
```csharp
// Define the start, due, and end dates for the task
DateTime StartDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime DueDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime EndByDate = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1);

// Adjust dates based on local time zone offset
timeZone localZone = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone;
TimeSpan ts = localZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now);
StartDate = StartDate.Add(ts);
DueDate = DueDate.Add(ts);
EndByDate = EndByDate.Add(ts);
```
**توضيح:**
The task's start, due, and end dates are adjusted for the current time zone offset to ensure accuracy across different regions.

#### Step 2: Create and Configure MapiTask
```csharp
// Create a new MapiTask with specified details
MapiTask task = new MapiTask("This is a test task", "Sample Body", StartDate, DueDate);
task.State = MapiTaskState.NotAssigned;
```
**توضيح:**
تهيئة `MapiTask` object with a title, body, start date, and due date. Set the task state to `NotAssigned`, marking it as pending.

#### Step 3: Set Weekly Recurrence Pattern
```csharp
// Configure the weekly recurrence pattern for the task
var rec = new MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern
{
    EndType = MapiCalendarRecurrenceEndType.EndAfterNOccurrences,
    PatternType = MapiCalendarRecurrencePatternType.Week,
    Period = 1,
    WeekStartDay = DayOfWeek.Sunday,
    DayOfWeek = MapiCalendarDayOfWeek.Friday,
    OccurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(StartDate, EndByDate, "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR"),
};

// Ensure there is at least one occurrence
if (rec.OccurrenceCount == 0)
{
    rec.OccurrenceCount = 1;
}
task.Recurrence = rec;
```
**توضيح:**
This snippet configures the task to recur weekly on Fridays. The `GetOccurrenceCount` function calculates how many occurrences fall between the start and end dates.

#### Step 4: Save Task
```csharp
// Save the task to a file in the specified output directory
string outputPath = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Weekly_out.msg";
task.Save(outputPath, TaskSaveFormat.Msg);
```
**توضيح:**
The completed task is saved as an MSG file. Ensure you replace `@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your actual path.

### Feature 2: Calculating Occurrences Between Two Dates with Recurrence Rule

**ملخص:**
Determine the number of times a recurring event occurs between two dates using Aspose.Email's `CalendarRecurrence` فصل.

#### Step 1: Define Dates and Recurrence Rule
```csharp
// Set start and end dates to calculate occurrences
DateTime Start = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime EndBy = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1);
string RRule = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR";
```
**توضيح:**
These variables set up the date range and define a rule for weekly occurrences on Fridays.

#### Step 2: Calculate Occurrences
```csharp
// Get the count of occurrences between the two dates based on the recurrence rule
uint occurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(Start, EndBy, RRule);
```
**توضيح:**
The function calculates how many times the task recurs within the specified period.

#### Step 3: Implement `GetOccurrenceCount` طريقة
```csharp
private static uint GetOccurrenceCount(DateTime start, DateTime endBy, string rrule)
{
    // Create a CalendarRecurrence object with DTSTART and RRULE format
    CalendarRecurrence pattern = new CalendarRecurrence(string.Format("DTSTART:{0}\r\nRRULE:{1}", start.ToString("yyyyMMdd"), rrule));

    // Generate occurrences within the specified date range
    DateCollection dates = pattern.GenerateOccurrences(start, endBy);

    // Return the count of generated occurrences
    return (uint)dates.Count;
}
```
**توضيح:**
ال `CalendarRecurrence` object is initialized with a start date and recurrence rule, generating occurrences that fall within the given range.
