## دليل التنفيذ

### Feature 1: Load and Parse Outlook Message File

The first step is to load an email message from a file. This feature will demonstrate how to extract basic properties such as subject, sender name, body content, and attachments.

#### ملخص
This section shows you how to utilize Aspose.Email for .NET to read an Outlook MSG or EML file and access its core components.

##### الخطوة 1: تحميل رسالة البريد الإلكتروني
Firstly, define the path where your email files are stored. Then load a message using `MapiMessage.FromMailMessage`.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;

public class Feature1
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/"; 
        MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(dataDir + "Message.eml");

        // Display email properties
        Console.WriteLine("Subject:" + msg.Subject);
        Console.WriteLine("From:" + msg.SenderName);
        Console.WriteLine("Body:" + msg.Body);
        Console.WriteLine("Attachment Count:" + msg.Attachments.Count);
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Loading the message provides access to all its elements, allowing for detailed data manipulation and extraction.

##### Step 2: Extract Email Properties
Use properties of `MapiMessage` to extract details like subject, sender name, and body content. The number of attachments is also displayed using `msg.Attachments.Count`.

### Feature 2: Iterate Through Attachments

Once you've loaded the email message, iterating through its attachments becomes straightforward.

#### ملخص
This part explains how to loop over each attachment in a message file and save them individually.

##### Step 1: Save Attachments
You can iterate over `msg.Attachments` and use the `Save` method for each one. Ensure you have an output directory set up for saving these files.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;

public class Feature2
{
    public static void Run(MapiMessage msg)
    {
        foreach (MapiAttachment attachment in msg.Attachments)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Attachment:" + attachment.FileName);
            string outputPath = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + attachment.LongFileName;
            attachment.Save(outputPath);
        }
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Saving attachments separately allows you to manage and store them as needed, which is particularly useful in automation tasks.

### التطبيقات العملية
Here are some real-world scenarios where parsing Outlook messages can be beneficial:

1. **أتمتة البريد الإلكتروني:** Automate the processing of incoming emails for customer service or support teams.
