# Tracking Email Document Conversion Progress with C# Code


In today's digital age, email communication plays a crucial role in both personal and professional spheres. As a programmer, you might have encountered the need to handle and manipulate email messages programmatically. One common task is tracking the progress of email document conversion, and in this article, we will guide you through the process step by step using C# and Aspose.Email for .NET.

## Introduction to Aspose.Email for .NET

Before diving into the code, let's have a brief introduction to Aspose.Email for .NET. This powerful library provides a wide range of features for working with email messages, including reading, writing, and converting emails in various formats. In our case, we will focus on email document conversion.

## Setting up Your Environment

To get started, you'll need to set up your development environment. Ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Email for .NET library installed. You can download it from [هنا](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).

Now, let's get into the code. We'll create a step-by-step guide on tracking email document conversion progress using the provided C# source code.

## Step 1: Loading the Email Message

We begin by loading the email message from a file. Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var fileName = dataDir + "test.eml";
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(fileName);
```

## Step 2: Defining a Custom Progress Handler

In this step, we set up a custom progress handler to monitor the conversion progress. The `ShowEmlConversionProgress` method will be called during the conversion process to provide information about the progress.

```csharp
private static void ShowEmlConversionProgress(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info)
{
    int total;
    int saved;
    switch (info.EventType)
    {
        case ProgressEventType.MimeStructureCreated:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine("MimeStructureCreated - TotalMimePartCount: " + total);
            Console.WriteLine("MimeStructureCreated - SavedMimePartCount: " + saved);
            break;
        case ProgressEventType.MimePartSaved:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine("MimePartSaved - TotalMimePartCount: " + total);
            Console.WriteLine("MimePartSaved - SavedMimePartCount: " + saved);
            break;
        case ProgressEventType.SavedToStream:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine("SavedToStream - TotalMimePartCount: " + total);
            Console.WriteLine("SavedToStream - SavedMimePartCount: " + saved);
            break;
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Saving the Email Message with Progress Tracking

Now, let's save the email message while tracking the progress. We use the `EmlSaveOptions` class with a custom progress handler.

```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
EmlSaveOptions opt = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.EmlFormat);
opt.CustomProgressHandler = new ConversionProgressEventHandler(ShowEmlConversionProgress);
msg.Save(ms, opt);
```
