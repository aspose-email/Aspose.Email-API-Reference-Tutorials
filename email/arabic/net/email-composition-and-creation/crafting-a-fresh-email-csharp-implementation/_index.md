Crafting and sending emails programmatically can greatly streamline various business processes, such as sending transactional notifications, marketing campaigns, and more. In this article, we'll explore how to create a fresh email using C# with the help of the Aspose.Email for .NET library. We'll cover everything step by step, from setting up the environment to sending the email, complete with source code examples.


## المتطلبات الأساسية

   MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
   ```

3. Set the sender, recipient, subject, and body of the email:

   ```csharp
   message.From = new MailAddress("sender@example.com");
   message.To.Add("recipient@example.com");
   message.Subject = "Hello from Aspose.Email!";
   message.Body = "This is the content of the email.";
   ```

## Configuring SMTP Settings

   client.Port = 587;
   client.Username = "your_username";
   client.Password = "your_password";
   client.SecurityOptions = SecurityOptions.Auto;
   ```

## إرسال البريد الإلكتروني

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       client.Send(message);
       Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully!");
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Error sending email: {ex.Message}");
   }
   ```
