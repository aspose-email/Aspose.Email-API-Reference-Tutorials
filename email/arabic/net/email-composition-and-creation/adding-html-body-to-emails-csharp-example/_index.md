# Adding HTML Body to Emails - C# Example

While plain text emails serve their purpose, incorporating HTML content into emails can greatly enhance their visual appeal and functionality.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into coding, make sure you have the Aspose.Email for .NET library integrated into your project. You can do this via NuGet package manager.

## إنشاء رسالة بريد إلكتروني جديدة

To begin, create a new instance of the `MailMessage` class. This class allows you to define various attributes of the email, such as sender, recipients, subject, and attachments.

```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = new MailAddress("sender@example.com");
message.To.Add("recipient@example.com");
message.Subject = "Hello from Aspose.Email!";
```

## Adding an HTML Body to the Email

Now comes the exciting part – adding an HTML body to your email. You can utilize the `HtmlBody` property of the `MailMessage` class to set the HTML content of your email.

```csharp
string htmlContent = "<html><body><h1>Welcome to our Newsletter!</h1><p>This is a sample HTML email body.</p></body></html>";
message.HtmlBody = htmlContent;
```

## Embedding Images in the HTML Body

To make your email even more visually appealing, you might want to embed images within the HTML body. You can achieve this by referencing the images using HTML tags with base64-encoded image data or by providing URLs to the image sources.

```csharp
string htmlContentWithImage = "<html><body><h1>Check out our New Product!</h1><img src='data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j...'></body></html>";
message.HtmlBody = htmlContentWithImage;
```

## إرسال البريد الإلكتروني

Once you've crafted your email to perfection, it's time to send it. Utilize your preferred email server's settings or a third-party service to send the email.

```csharp
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "username", "password");
client.Send(message);
```
