Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin setting up and implementing our solution.
## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 16 or later installed on your machine.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.
- **Maven:** To manage project dependencies.

You should also be familiar with basic Java programming concepts, including object-oriented principles and exception handling. If you're new to these topics, consider reviewing some introductory resources first.
## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
To use Aspose.Email for Java, add it as a dependency in your Maven project:
**Maven Dependency**
Add the following snippet to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```
### License Acquisition
Aspose.Email for Java offers a free trial version, but you might want to purchase a license or request a temporary one for extended usage:
- **Free Trial:** [Download Aspose.Email](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/)
- **Temporary License:** [Request Here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/)
- **Purchase License:** [Buy Now](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy)
After setting up your project and obtaining a license, initialize the library in your Java application:
```java
import com.aspose.email.Pop3Client;
import com.aspose.email.SecurityOptions;

Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client("host.domain.com", 456, "username", "password");
client.setSecurityOptions(SecurityOptions.Auto);
```
## Implementation Guide
### Retrieve Message Summary Information Using Sequence Number
This feature allows you to access message details by specifying a sequence number assigned by the server.
#### Initialize Your Client
Create an instance of `Pop3Client` and set security options:
```java
Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client("host.domain.com", 456, "username", "password");
client.setSecurityOptions(SecurityOptions.Auto);
```
#### Fetch Message Info Using Sequence Number
Retrieve message summary details using the sequence number:
```java
String seqNum = "sequence number of a message from server";
Pop3MessageInfo messageInfo = client.getMessageInfo(seqNum);

if (messageInfo != null) {
    String subject = messageInfo.getSubject();
    String date = messageInfo.getDate();

    System.out.println("Subject: " + subject);
    System.out.println("Date: " + date);
}
```
- **Parameters:** Sequence number as a string identifier.
- **Return Value:** `Pop3MessageInfo` object containing the email details.
### Retrieve Message Summary Information Using Unique ID
This feature is similar but uses a unique ID instead of sequence numbers to fetch message summaries.
#### Fetch Message Info Using Unique ID
Access message information via its unique identifier:
```java
String uniqueId = "unique id of a message from server";
Pop3MessageInfo messageInfo = client.getMessageInfo(uniqueId);

if (messageInfo != null) {
    String subject = messageInfo.getSubject();
    String date = messageInfo.getDate();

    System.out.println("Subject: " + subject);
    System.out.println("Date: " + date);
}
```
- **Parameters:** Unique ID as a string identifier.
- **Return Value:** `Pop3MessageInfo` object containing the email details.
## Practical Applications
Aspose.Email for Java can be leveraged in various scenarios, including:
