## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Read and Delivery Receipt Information

This feature allows you to extract when emails are delivered and read by recipients from an MSG file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1:** Load the MSG File
```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiMessage;
import com.aspose.email.MapiRecipient;
import com.aspose.email.MapiPropertyTag;

public class RetrieveReceipts {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/outlook/";
        MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "message.msg");
```
**Step 2:** Iterate Over Recipients
```java
        for (MapiRecipient recipient : msg.getRecipients()) {
            System.out.println("Recipient: " + recipient.getDisplayName());
```
**Step 3:** Retrieve and Print Delivery Time
```java
            System.out.println("Delivery time: " + 
                recipient.getProperties().get_Item(MapiPropertyTag.PR_RECIPIENT_TRACKSTATUS_TIME_DELIVERY).getDateTime());
```
**Step 4:** Retrieve and Print Read Time
```java
            System.out.println("Read time: " + 
                recipient.getProperties().get_Item(MapiPropertyTag.PR_RECIPIENT_TRACKSTATUS_TIME_READ).getDateTime());
        }
    }
}
```

### Reading Vote Results Information

This feature helps extract how recipients have voted and when they responded, crucial for decision-making processes.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1:** Load the MSG File
```java
import com.aspose.email.MapiMessage;
import com.aspose.email.MapiRecipient;
import com.aspose.email.MapiPropertyTag;

public class ReadVoteResults {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/outlook/";
        MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "message.msg");
```
**Step 2:** Iterate Over Recipients
```java
        for (MapiRecipient recipient : msg.getRecipients()) {
            System.out.println("Recipient: " + recipient.getDisplayName());
```
**Step 3:** Retrieve and Print Response
```java
            System.out.println("Response: " + 
                recipient.getProperties().get_Item(MapiPropertyTag.PR_RECIPIENT_AUTORESPONSE_PROP_RESPONSE).getString());
```
**Step 4:** Retrieve and Print Response Time
```java
            System.out.println("Response time: " + 
                recipient.getProperties().get_Item(MapiPropertyTag.PR_RECIPIENT_TRACKSTATUS_TIME).getDateTime());
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Email Campaign Tracking:** Use receipt data to measure open rates and delivery success.
2. **Survey Analysis:** Quickly analyze vote results from email-based surveys.
3. **Customer Feedback Management:** Retrieve and process responses efficiently to improve services.

Integrating with CRM systems or analytics tools can provide deeper insights into communication efficacy.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize performance by handling large MSG files in chunks if necessary.
- Monitor memory usage, especially when processing numerous emails, to prevent leaks.
- Utilize efficient data structures for storing and accessing recipient properties.
