# SMTP Email Forwarding Using Aspose.Email for Java: A Comprehensive Guide

In the digital era, managing emails programmatically is essential for developers working on enterprise or customer communication systems. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of setting up an SMTP client with Aspose.Email for Java to forward emails efficiently without using `MailMessage`. Let’s explore how this powerful tool can meet your email automation needs.

## What You'll Learn:
- Configuring an SMTP Client with Aspose.Email for Java
- Managing Email Recipients Using a Collection
- Forwarding Emails Directly from File Streams

**Prerequisites:** Before diving in, ensure you have the following setup ready to follow this tutorial effectively.

### Prerequisites
To successfully complete this guide, make sure you have:

- **Libraries and Dependencies:**
  - Aspose.Email for Java version 25.4 or later.
  
- **Environment Setup:**
  - A compatible JDK (Java Development Kit), preferably JDK 16 as specified by the classifier in our Maven dependency.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
  - Basic understanding of SMTP protocols
  - Familiarity with Java programming

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

Integrating Aspose.Email into your project is straightforward using Maven. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Acquiring a License
Aspose.Email offers a free trial license to test its full capabilities without limitations. Here’s how you can acquire it:

1. **Free Trial:** Visit [Aspose's Free Trial page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/) to download and start with the evaluation version.
2. **Temporary License:** For extended testing, request a temporary license through the [License Request page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase:** If you find Aspose.Email beneficial for your projects, consider purchasing a full license at [Aspose's Purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once Aspose.Email is included in your project, initialize the necessary components:

```java
import com.aspose.email.SecurityOptions;
import com.aspose.email.SmtpClient;

String host = "mail.domain.com"; // Your SMTP server address
String username = "username";    // Username for authentication
int smtpPort = 587;              // Port number, typically 587 for TLS/STARTTLS
String password = "password";    // Password for authentication

// Create an instance of SmtpClient with specified credentials.
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(host, smtpPort, username, password, SecurityOptions.SSLExplicit);
```

## Implementation Guide

### SMTP Client Configuration
This section guides you through configuring an SMTP client for sending emails. By setting up the `SmtpClient`, you establish a connection with your email server using specified credentials and security options.

#### Overview
The configuration involves specifying your SMTP host, port, username, password, and security option—typically SSLExplicit for secure connections.

```java
import com.aspose.email.SecurityOptions;
import com.aspose.email.SmtpClient;

String host = "mail.domain.com";
String username = "username";
int smtpPort = 587;
String password = "password";

// Initialize the SmtpClient with specified credentials.
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(host, smtpPort, username, password, SecurityOptions.SSLExplicit);
```

### Email Recipients Collection
Managing a list of recipients is streamlined using `MailAddressCollection`, which allows you to add multiple email addresses easily.

#### Overview
This collection enables the storage and management of recipient emails for forwarding or sending operations.

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailAddressCollection;

// Create a new MailAddressCollection instance.
MailAddressCollection recipients = new MailAddressCollection();

// Add multiple recipients to the collection.
recipients.add("to1@domain.com");
recipients.add("to2@domain.com");
```

### Email Forwarding without Using MailMessage
This powerful feature allows you to forward an email file directly using a `FileInputStream` and the `SmtpClient`.

#### Overview
Instead of creating a new `MailMessage`, this method uses existing EML files, making it efficient for bulk forwarding.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

String fileName = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/test.eml"; // Path to your EML file

// Open the FileInputStream for the email file.
FileInputStream fos = new FileInputStream(fileName);

try {
    // Forward the email using the SmtpClient instance and recipients collection.
    client.forward("Sender@domain.com\
