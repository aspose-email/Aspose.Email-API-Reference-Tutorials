- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
To start, set up the Aspose.Email library in your Java project:

### Maven Installation
Add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
