## Implementation Guide
Explore various functionalities you can implement with Aspose.Email for Java.

### Initialize and Access PST File
**Overview**: Learn to initialize a PST file and access its predefined folders such as Inbox and Deleted Items.
#### Step 1: Load the PST File
```java
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/test.pst");
```
#### Step 2: Access Predefined Folders
- **Inbox Folder**:
    ```java
    FolderInfo inbox = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
    ```
  
- **Deleted Items Folder**:
    ```java
    FolderInfo deletedItems = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);
    ```
### Move a Subfolder to Another Folder in PST
**Overview**: Learn how to move an entire subfolder from one folder to another within the PST file.
#### Step 1: Access Source and Destination Folders
```java
FolderInfo inbox = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
FolderInfo deletedItems = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);
```
#### Step 2: Get a Specific Subfolder from the Inbox
```java
FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.getSubFolder("Subfolder");
```
#### Step 3: Move the Entire Subfolder
```java
pst.moveItem(subfolder, deletedItems);
```
### Move Individual Messages Between Folders in PST
**Overview**: This feature allows moving individual messages from one folder to another.
#### Step 1: Retrieve Messages from a Specific Subfolder
```java
FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.getSubFolder("Subfolder");
MessageInfoCollection contents = subfolder.getContents();
```
#### Step 2: Move the First Message to Deleted Items Folder
```java
pst.moveItem(contents.get_Item(0), deletedItems);
```
### Move All Subfolders From One Folder to Another in PST
**Overview**: Learn how to move all subfolders from one folder, like Inbox, to another, such as Deleted Items.
#### Step 1: Access Source and Destination Folders
```java
FolderInfo inbox = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
FolderInfo deletedItems = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);
```
#### Step 2: Move All Subfolders
```java
inbox.moveSubfolders(deletedItems);
```
### Move All Contents of a Subfolder to Another Folder in PST
**Overview**: Learn how to transfer all contents from one subfolder to another folder within the PST file.
#### Step 1: Access Source and Destination Folders
```java
FolderInfo inbox = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
FolderInfo deletedItems = pst.getPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);
```
#### Step 2: Get a Specific Subfolder from the Inbox
```java
FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.getSubFolder("Subfolder");
```
#### Step 3: Move All Contents of the Subfolder
```java
subfolder.moveContents(deletedItems);
```
