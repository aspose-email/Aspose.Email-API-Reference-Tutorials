## Implementation Guide

### Setting HTML Body of Email
This feature allows you to set an HTML body for your emails, making them visually appealing and more informative.

#### Creating a MailMessage Instance

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
import com.aspose.email.SaveOptions;

public class FeatureSetHTMLBody {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new instance of MailMessage
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
        
        // Set the HTML body content for your email
        message.setHtmlBody("<html><body>This is the HTML body</body></html>");
```

#### Saving the Email

```java
        // Define the output path for saving the email (replace with actual directory)
        String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SetHtmlBody_out.eml";

        // Save the MailMessage as an EML file using default save options
        message.save(outputPath, SaveOptions.getDefaultEml());
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Parameters:**
- **`setHtmlBody(String htmlContent)`**: This method sets the HTML content of the email body. It allows you to include rich text, links, images, and other formatting.
  
- **`save(String filePath, SaveOptions options)`**: Saves the `MailMessage` object to a file in EML format using specified save options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your HTML content is well-formed to prevent rendering issues.
