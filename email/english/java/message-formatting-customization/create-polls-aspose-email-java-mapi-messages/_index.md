# How to Create Interactive Polls in Emails Using Aspose.Email Java and MAPI Messages

## Introduction

Enhancing email communications by adding interactive polls can transform your engagement strategy. Whether you need client feedback or want to involve your team more effectively, creating polls within emails is a powerful tool. This tutorial guides you through using the Aspose.Email library in Java to build engaging polls via MAPI messages, streamlining decision-making and gathering insights efficiently.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Email for Java.
- Creating a poll with voting options within a MAPI message.
- Saving the enhanced email message.
- Real-world applications of polling.

Let's begin by ensuring you have all necessary prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Email for Java Library**: Install version 25.4 or later to access full features.
- **Java Development Environment**: Your environment should be set up with JDK 16 or higher.
- **Basic Java Knowledge**: Familiarity with Java programming concepts will aid comprehension.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

### Maven Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### License Acquisition

To fully utilize Aspose.Email without limitations, consider obtaining a license:
- **Free Trial**: Start with the free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license if needed.
- **Purchase**: Purchase a full license for continued use.

**Initialization and Setup:**

After setting up your environment, initialize Aspose.Email in your Java application:

```java
// Initialize Aspose.Email library
License emailLicense = new License();
emailLicense.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: Creating a Poll with MAPI Message

This section walks you through creating and configuring a poll within an email using Aspose.Email's `FollowUpManager` class.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories

Define paths for your document and output directories:

```java
String dataDir = YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "outlook/";
```

Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual path to your directory.

#### Step 2: Create a Test MAPI Message

Create a test message without setting it as a draft. This serves as our base for adding polling options:

```java
MapiMessage msg = createTestMessage(false);
```

#### Step 3: Initialize FollowUpOptions and Set Voting Buttons

Configure the `FollowUpOptions` to include your desired voting buttons:

```java
FollowUpOptions options = new FollowUpOptions();
options.setVotingButtons("Yes;No;Maybe;Exactly!");
```

This step allows you to specify multiple polling choices.

#### Step 4: Apply Follow-Up Options to the Message

Attach the configured follow-up options to your message:

```java
FollowUpManager.setOptions(msg, options);
```

By setting these options, you enable interactive voting within your email.

#### Step 5: Save the Enhanced Email Message

Finally, save the MAPI message with polling capabilities:

```java
msg.save(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "MapiMsgWithPoll_out.msg");
```

This step ensures that your poll is embedded in a file ready for distribution or testing.

### Helper Method to Create a Test MAPI Message

Here's how you can create a basic test message, which will be enhanced with polling options:

```java
private static MapiMessage createTestMessage(boolean draft) {
    return new MapiMessage("from@test.com", "to@test.com",
                           "Polling Feature in Aspose.Email", "This is a test message.");
}
```

## Practical Applications

Creating polls within emails can significantly enhance your communication strategies. Here are some practical applications:

1. **Client Feedback**: Collect client preferences for upcoming product features.
2. **Team Surveys**: Gather team opinions on workplace improvements or project directions.
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Measure customer satisfaction with recent purchases or services.
4. **Event Planning**: Decide on event themes or activities based on attendee input.
5. **Marketing Insights**: Understand consumer interests and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
