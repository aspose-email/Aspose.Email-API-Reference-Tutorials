## Implementation Guide

### Setting Email Headers with Aspose.Email

#### Overview

Setting custom headers in emails allows you to include additional metadata or control specific behaviors of the email. With Aspose.Email for Java, this process is straightforward and highly customizable.

##### Create a New MailMessage Instance

Start by creating an instance of the `MailMessage` class:

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailAddress;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

// Create a new instance of MailMessage
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

##### Set Email Subject and HTML Body

Customize your email's subject and body to suit your needs:

```java
// Set subject of the message
message.setSubject("New message created by Aspose.Email for Java");

// Set Html body
message.setHtmlBody("<b>This line is in bold.</b> <br/> <br/><font color=blue>This line is in blue color</font>");
```

##### Add Sender Information

Ensure your email includes the sender's details:

```java
// Set sender information
message.setFrom(new MailAddress("from@domain.com"));
```

### Setting Custom Headers

You can add custom headers using the `addHeader` method. This allows you to include any additional metadata required for your use case.

```java
// Add a custom header
message.addHeader("X-Custom-Header", "HeaderValue");
```

#### Explanation of Parameters and Methods

- **setSubject(String):** Sets the subject line of the email.
- **setHtmlBody(String):** Allows you to define HTML content for richer text formatting.
- **setFrom(MailAddress):** Specifies the sender's address.
- **addHeader(String, String):** Adds custom headers. The first parameter is the header name, and the second is its value.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If your emails aren't sending as expected:

- Ensure all required fields (like `To`, `From`) are correctly set.
- Verify that any custom headers follow the correct format.
- Check for valid email addresses to avoid delivery issues.

## Practical Applications

1. **Automated Notifications:** Customize headers to include metadata like notification types or user IDs.
