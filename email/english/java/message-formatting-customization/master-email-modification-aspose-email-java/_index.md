## Implementation Guide

We will break down the email modification process into logical sections based on functionality. Each section includes steps to accomplish specific tasks with code snippets and explanations.

### Modify Email Subject (H2)

**Overview:** This feature allows you to load an existing MSG file, modify its subject by appending text, and save the changes.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Email:**
   
   ```java
   String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(ModifyAnExistingEmailMessage.class) + "email/";
   MailMessage email = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "Message.msg");
   ```

2. **Modify the Subject:**
   Retrieve the current subject, append new text, and update it.
   
   ```java
   String subject = email.getSubject();
   subject += " This text is added to the existing subject";
   email.setSubject(subject);
   ```

### Modify Email Body (H2)

**Overview:** Change the HTML body content of an email by appending additional HTML text.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Email:**
   Reuse the loading code from the previous section.

2. **Modify the Body:**
   
   ```java
   String body = email.getHtmlBody();
   body += "<br> This text is added to the existing body";
   email.setHtmlBody(body);
   ```

### Modify Email TO List (H2)

**Overview:** Update the 'To' recipients of an email by removing a recipient and adding a new one.

#### Steps:
1. **Load Recipients:**
   
   ```java
   MailAddressCollection contacts = new MailAddressCollection(email.getTo());
   ```

2. **Modify the TO List:**
   Remove the first recipient if present, then add a new address.
   
   ```java
   if (contacts.size() > 0) {
       contacts.removeAt(0);
       contacts.add("to1@domain.com");
   }
   email.setTo(contacts);
   ```

### Modify Email CC List (H2)

**Overview:** Add a recipient to the 'CC' list of an email.

#### Steps:
1. **Load Recipients:**
   
   ```java
   MailAddressCollection ccContacts = new MailAddressCollection(email.getCC());
   ```

2. **Modify the CC List:**
   Simply add a new address to the CC list.
   
   ```java
   ccContacts.add("cc2@domain.com");
   email.setCC(ccContacts);
   ```

### Save Email Message (H2)

**Overview:** After making all modifications, save the updated email back to disk.

#### Steps:
1. **Save Changes:**
   Ensure all previous modifications have been made before saving.
   
   ```java
   String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   email.save(outputDir + "ModifyingAnExistingEmailMessage_out.msg");
   ```

## Practical Applications

- **Automated Email Management:** Use these methods in customer service systems to update email communications dynamically.
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Modify emails in bulk for personalized marketing messages.
- **Internal Communication Tools:** Implement features in internal tools that require dynamic email updates.

## Performance Considerations (H2)

When working with large volumes of emails:
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Manage Java memory efficiently by disposing of objects no longer needed.
- **Batch Processing:** Process emails in batches to reduce memory overhead and improve performance.
