Automate repetitive email tasks and streamline your workflow.

In today's fast-paced digital environment, efficiently managing large volumes of emails is crucial. This tutorial helps you harness the power of Aspose.Email for Java to connect to Exchange Web Services (EWS) and automate your email management processes effortlessly.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- Setting up an EWS client using Aspose.Email for Java.
- Retrieving mailbox information with ease.
- Listing messages from your inbox folder.
- Moving emails based on specific subject criteria.

Let’s dive into the prerequisites before we start implementing these features.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
Include Aspose.Email for Java in your project. If using Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 or higher.
- Maven for managing project dependencies.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with RESTful APIs and email protocols like EWS.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
To utilize Aspose.Email, first configure it in your development environment. Here’s how:

1. **Installation via Maven**
   Ensure the dependency snippet provided above is included in your `pom.xml`. This will fetch necessary libraries automatically when building your project.

2. **License Acquisition Steps**
   - Start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/) to evaluate Aspose.Email's features.
   - Obtain a temporary license for extended access without limitations by visiting [this link](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
   - Purchase a full license if you decide to integrate it into your production environment. More details can be found on the [Aspose purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

3. **Basic Initialization and Setup**
   Initialize an EWS client by providing the Exchange service URL, user credentials, and domain:
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
   import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

   // Initialize the EWS Client
   IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
       "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx",
       "testUser",
       "pwd",
       "domain"
   );
   ```

## Implementation Guide

### Creating an EWS Client
**Overview:**
Creating an instance of the `IEWSClient` class is your first step to managing emails through EWS. This connection allows you to perform various operations such as retrieving mailbox details or moving messages.

**Steps:**
1. **Import Necessary Packages:**
   Ensure you have imported required packages for Aspose.Email:
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
   import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;
   ```

2. **Initialize the EWS Client:**
   Use your Exchange service URL, credentials, and domain to establish a connection.
   ```java
   IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
       "https://outlook.office365.com/exchangeews/exchange.asmx",
       "testUser",
       "pwd",
       "domain"
   );
   ```

### Retrieving Mailbox Information
**Overview:**
After establishing a connection, fetch mailbox details like the URI of various folders using the `IEWSClient` instance.

**Steps:**
1. **Import ExchangeMailboxInfo Package:**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMailboxInfo;
   ```

2. **Get Mailbox Info:**
   Use the client to retrieve mailbox information.
   ```java
   ExchangeMailboxInfo mailboxInfo = client.getMailboxInfo();
   ```

### Listing Messages from Inbox
**Overview:**
Access and list all messages in your inbox using the mailbox URI obtained previously.

**Steps:**
1. **Import Message Info Packages:**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfo;
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;
   ```

2. **List Messages:**
   Fetch message information for further processing.
   ```java
   ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgInfoColl = client.listMessages(mailboxInfo.getInboxUri());
   ```

### Moving Messages to Another Folder
**Overview:**
Move messages based on specific criteria, such as subjects containing certain keywords.

**Steps:**
1. **Iterate Through Messages:**
   Check each message for the desired subject.
   ```java
   for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgInfoColl) {
       if (msgInfo.getSubject() != null && msgInfo.getSubject().contains("process this message")) {
           // Move item logic here
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Move Messages:**
   If criteria are met, move the message to a designated folder.
   ```java
   client.moveItem(
       msgInfo.getUniqueUri(),
       client.getMailboxInfo().getRootUri() + "/Processed/" + msgInfo.getSubject()
   );
   ```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure your credentials and Exchange service URL are correct.
- Verify that the "Processed" folder exists or is correctly specified.
