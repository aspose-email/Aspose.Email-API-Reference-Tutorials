### Basic Initialization
Here's how you initialize the EWS client:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "domain.com");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Connect to Exchange Server
**Overview:** Connecting to an Exchange server is essential for managing emails and contacts. With Aspose.Email, this process becomes straightforward.

#### Step 1: Initialize the EWS Client
```java
// Import necessary classes
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;

// Connect using credentials
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "domain.com");
```
*Explanation:* The `getEWSClient` method connects to the Exchange server using your domain's URL, username, password, and domain name.

### Create a Subfolder in Contacts Folder
**Overview:** Organize contacts by creating subfolders within the main Contacts folder.

#### Step 1: Create a New Folder
```java
// Import necessary classes
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderInfo;
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeFolderType;

// Create 'myfolder' under Contacts
ExchangeFolderInfo folderInfo = client.createFolder("myfolder", ExchangeFolderType.Contact);
```
*Explanation:* The `createFolder` method creates a new folder named "myfolder" within the Contacts directory.

### Create a MapiContact in Subfolder
**Overview:** Add individual contacts to the newly created subfolder using MAPI format.

#### Step 1: Create and Save a MapiContact
```java
// Import necessary classes
import com.aspose.email.MapiContact;

// Create and save a new contact
client.createContact(folderInfo.getUri(), new MapiContact("MapiContact", "foo@gmail.com"));
```
*Explanation:* The `createContact` method saves the `MapiContact` object to the specified folder URI.

### Create an Aspose.Email Contact in Subfolder
**Overview:** Use Aspose.Email's Contact class for more extensive contact management.

#### Step 1: Initialize and Save a Contact
```java
// Import necessary classes
import com.aspose.email.Contact;

// Initialize a new Contact object
Contact contact = new Contact();
contact.setDisplayName("Contact");

// Save the created contact
client.createContact(folderInfo.getUri(), contact);
```
*Explanation:* The `createContact` method saves an Aspose.Email `Contact` object in the designated subfolder.

### List Contacts in Subfolder
**Overview:** Retrieve a list of all contacts within a specific subfolder to manage them effectively.

#### Step 1: List Contacts
```java
// Import necessary classes
import com.aspose.email.MapiContact[];

// Get all contacts from 'myfolder'
MapiContact[] myfolderContacts = client.listContacts(folderInfo.getUri());
```
*Explanation:* The `listContacts` method retrieves an array of `MapiContact` objects stored in the specified folder URI.

## Practical Applications
