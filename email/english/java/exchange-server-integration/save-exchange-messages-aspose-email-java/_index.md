- Fetch and save messages in MSG format.

Let's begin by reviewing the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Email for Java library**: We’ll use version 25.4 with the `jdk16` classifier.
- **Maven** setup on your development environment to manage dependencies easily.

```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Save Messages as EML

#### Overview
This feature allows you to save messages from your Exchange Server inbox directly to disk in the EML format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create an `ExchangeClient` Instance:**
```java
// Create instance of ExchangeClient with server details and credentials
ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient("http://servername/exchange/username", "username", "password", "domain");
```

**Retrieve Messages from the Inbox:**
```java
// Retrieve message information from the inbox
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri());
```

**Save Each Message as an EML File:**
```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    // Save each message in the specified directory
    client.saveMessage(strMessageURI, "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + ".eml");
}
```

### Feature 2: Save Messages to OutputStream

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to save messages directly into an output stream.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create an `ExchangeClient` Instance:**
```java
// Create instance of ExchangeClient with server details and credentials
ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient("http://ex07sp1/exchange/Administrator", "user", "pwd", "domain");
```

**Retrieve Messages from the Inbox:**
```java
// Retrieve message information from the inbox
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri());
```

**Save Each Message to an OutputStream:**
```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    try {
        // Create an output stream for the message data
        OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + "_Out.eml");
        client.saveMessage(strMessageURI, outputStream);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  // Handle exceptions appropriately
    }
}
```

### Feature 3: Save Messages in MSG Format

#### Overview
This feature fetches and saves messages from your Exchange Server inbox as MSG files.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create an `ExchangeClient` Instance:**
```java
// Create instance of ExchangeClient with server details and credentials
ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient("http://ex07sp1/exchange/Administrator", "user", "pwd", "domain");
```

**Retrieve Messages from the Inbox:**
```java
// Retrieve message information from the inbox
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgCollection = client.listMessages(client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri());
```

**Fetch and Save Each Message as MSG:**
```java
for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgCollection) {
    String strMessageURI = msgInfo.getUniqueUri();
    // Fetch complete message details
    MailMessage msg = client.fetchMessage(strMessageURI);
    // Save the message as an MSG file
    msg.save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + msgInfo.getMessageId() + ".msg", SaveOptions.getDefaultMsg());
}
```
