## Implementation Guide (H2)
We'll break down the implementation into manageable sections, focusing on key features of Aspose.Email for Java.

### Exchange Server Setup
#### Overview
Setting up an `ExchangeClient` is crucial for interacting with your Exchange Server using WebDAV. This setup allows you to send and receive emails programmatically.

#### Implementation Steps (H3)
1. **Define Domain and Server Details**:
   ```java
   String domain = "litwareinc.com";
   ```
2. **Create the `ExchangeClient` Instance**:
   ```java
   ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient(
       "http://MachineName/exchange/Username", 
       "username", 
       "password", 
       domain
   );
   ```
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure you handle exceptions to catch any connection issues.
   ```java
   try {
       // Connection code here
   } catch (Exception ex) {
       System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
   }
   ```

### Create Meeting Request
#### Overview
Creating meeting requests programmatically can save time and ensure accuracy.

#### Implementation Steps (H3)
1. **Parse Dates**:
   ```java
   SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss");
   Date startDate = sdf.parse("10/05/2015 10:00:00");
   Date endDate = sdf.parse("10/05/2015 10:30:00");
   ```
2. **Create Attendee Collection**:
   ```java
   MailAddressCollection coll = new MailAddressCollection();
   coll.add("bob@litwareinc.com");
   ```
3. **Create Appointment Request**:
   ```java
   Appointment app = new Appointment(
       "meeting request", 
       startDate, 
       endDate, 
       new MailAddress("administrator@litwareinc.com"), 
       coll
   );
   app.setSummary("Meeting Summary");
   app.setDescription("Meeting Description");
   ```

### Create and Send Email Message with Meeting Request
#### Overview
Combining email messages with meeting requests enhances communication efficiency.

#### Implementation Steps (H3)
1. **Prepare Email Addresses**:
   ```java
   MailAddressCollection coll = new MailAddressCollection();
   coll.add("bob@litwareinc.com");
   ```
2. **Create and Configure `MailMessage`**:
   ```java
   MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();
   msg.setFrom(new MailAddress("administrator@litwareinc.com"));
   msg.setTo(coll);
   msg.isBodyHtml(true);  
   msg.setHtmlBody("<h3>Meeting Details</h3><p>Here are the details of your meeting request.</p>");
   msg.setSubject("Meeting Request");
   ```
3. **Attach Meeting Request**:
   ```java
   Appointment app = new Appointment(
       "meeting request",
       startDate,  
       endDate,
       new MailAddress("administrator@litwareinc.com"),
       coll
   );
   msg.addAlternateView(app.requestApointment(0));
   ```
4. **Send Message via `ExchangeClient`**:
   ```java
   client.send(msg);
   ```
5. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling to manage exceptions during sending.
   ```java
   try {
       // Sending code here
   } catch (Exception ex) {
       System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
   }
   ```
