## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure your setup meets these requirements:

### Required Libraries
Include Aspose.Email in your project. If using Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Environment Setup
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Access to an Exchange Server with EWS enabled.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with working with APIs will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
Follow these steps to set up your environment:
1. **Library Installation**: Ensure the Aspose.Email dependency is correctly added as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**:
   - Start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).
   - For extended use, consider purchasing a license or obtaining a temporary one from [Aspose's licensing page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Basic Initialization**: Initialize your EWSClient to connect to the Exchange server:

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
    "https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx",
    "username", 
    "password", 
    "domain.com"
);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Connect to Exchange Server
**Overview**: Establishing a connection is the first step in server interaction.
1. **Initialize EWSClient**
   - Use `EWSClient.getEWSClient` method, passing the EWS URL, username, password, and domain as parameters.

```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(
    "https://exchange.domain.com/exchangeews/Exchange.asmx",
    "username", 
    "password", 
    "domain.com"
);
```

### Retrieve Contacts from Exchange Server
**Overview**: Fetch all contacts stored in the specified mailbox.
1. **Get Contacts URI**
   - Use `client.getMailboxInfo().getContactsUri()` to retrieve the URI for contacts.

```java
String contactsUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getContactsUri();
```
2. **Fetch Contacts**
   - Retrieve contact objects using `client.getContacts(contactsUri)`.

```java
Contact[] contacts = client.getContacts(contactsUri);
// 'contacts' now holds all retrieved contact objects.
```

### Update Contact Display Name
**Overview**: Modify a specific contact's display name on the server.
1. **Select and Update Contact**
   - Choose a contact from the array.
   - Use `contactToUpdate.setDisplayName("New Name")` to update its name.

```java
Contact contactToUpdate = contacts[0];
contactToUpdate.setDisplayName("David Ch");
```
2. **Save Changes**
   - Persist changes with `client.updateContact(contactToUpdate)`.

```java
client.updateContact(contactToUpdate);
// The contact's display name has been updated.
```

Aspose.Email offers numerous integration possibilities:
1. **Automated Contact Management**: Streamline updating and maintaining large volumes of contacts.
2. **HR Systems Integration**: Sync employee contact details with HR databases for seamless updates across platforms.
3. **CRM Enhancements**: Integrate with CRM tools to ensure up-to-date client information.
