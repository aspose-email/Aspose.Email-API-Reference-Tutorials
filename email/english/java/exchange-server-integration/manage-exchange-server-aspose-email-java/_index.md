- Listing messages from the Inbox folder
- Moving messages based on specific criteria

By mastering these functionalities, you will unlock powerful email management capabilities directly through your Java applications.

Let's ensure you have everything set up before diving into implementation.
## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 16 or higher
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Any popular IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- **Maven:** For managing dependencies and builds
- **Exchange Server Access:** Credentials for your Exchange server

A basic understanding of Java programming, especially working with APIs, will also be beneficial.
## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java
### Maven Dependency
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```
### License Acquisition
To utilize Aspose.Email for Java fully, you will need a license. Here's how to get started:
1. **Free Trial:** Access a temporary 30-day license by visiting the [free trial page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).
2. **Temporary License:** For more extended evaluation without limitations, apply for a temporary license on the [temporary license page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase:** To acquire a permanent license, visit the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
### Basic Initialization
Begin by setting up your project structure and initializing the Aspose.Email library:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeClient;

public class EmailSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Exchange client with server details (this will be configured later)
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Connecting to Exchange Server
#### Overview
Connecting your Java application to an Exchange Server allows you to manage emails programmatically. This section demonstrates how to establish this connection using Aspose.Email for Java.
#### Code Setup
1. **Create the Connection**
   Define your server details and credentials:
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeClient;

   public class ConnectToExchangeServer {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String mailboxURI = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual URI
           String username = "username"; // Replace with actual username
           String password = "password"; // Replace with actual password
           String domain = "domain"; // Replace with actual domain

           ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient(mailboxURI, username, password, domain);
       }
   }
   ```
   **Parameters:**
   - `mailboxURI`: The URI of your Exchange server.
   - `username`, `password`, `domain`: Credentials for authentication.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the `mailboxURI` is correct and accessible from your network.
- Verify your credentials to avoid authentication errors.
### Retrieving Mailbox Information
#### Overview
Once connected, retrieving mailbox information provides insights into available folders and settings.
#### Code Setup
1. **Retrieve Mailbox Data**
   Use the `ExchangeClient` to access mailbox details:
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMailboxInfo;

   public class RetrieveMailboxInfo {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String mailboxURI = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual URI
           String username = "username"; // Replace with actual username
           String password = "password"; // Replace with actual password
           String domain = "domain"; // Replace with actual domain

           ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient(mailboxURI, username, password, domain);

           ExchangeMailboxInfo mailboxInfo = client.getMailboxInfo();
       }
   }
   ```
### Listing Messages from Inbox Folder
#### Overview
Accessing messages in the Inbox folder helps manage incoming emails efficiently.
#### Code Setup
1. **List Inbox Messages**
   Retrieve and list all messages:
   ```java
   import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;

   public class ListMessagesFromInbox {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String mailboxURI = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual URI
           String username = "username"; // Replace with actual username
           String password = "password"; // Replace with actual password
           String domain = "domain"; // Replace with actual domain

           ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient(mailboxURI, username, password, domain);

           ExchangeMailboxInfo mailboxInfo = client.getMailboxInfo();

           ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgInfoColl = client.listMessages(mailboxInfo.getInboxUri());
       }
   }
   ```
### Moving Messages Based on Criteria
#### Overview
Automate message organization by moving them based on specific criteria.
#### Code Setup
1. **Move Specific Messages**
   Filter and move messages:
   ```java
   public class MoveMessages {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String mailboxURI = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual URI
           String username = "username"; // Replace with actual username
           String password = "password"; // Replace with actual password
           String domain = "domain"; // Replace with actual domain

           ExchangeClient client = new ExchangeClient(mailboxURI, username, password, domain);

           ExchangeMailboxInfo mailboxInfo = client.getMailboxInfo();

           ExchangeMessageInfoCollection msgInfoColl = client.listMessages(mailboxInfo.getInboxUri());

           for (ExchangeMessageInfo msgInfo : msgInfoColl) {
               if (msgInfo.getSubject() != null && msgInfo.getSubject().contains("process this message")) {
                   client.moveMessage(msgInfo, mailboxInfo.getRootUri() + "/Processed/" + msgInfo.getSubject());
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
## Practical Applications
1. **Automated Email Management:** Automate sorting and processing of incoming emails.
