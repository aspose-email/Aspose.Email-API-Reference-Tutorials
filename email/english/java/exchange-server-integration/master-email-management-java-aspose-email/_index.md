## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

To start working with Aspose.Email, follow these steps to integrate it into your project using Maven:

**Maven Dependency**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: You can start by downloading a free trial from [Aspose Email Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).
- **Temporary License**: For more extended access, consider applying for a temporary license at [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once you have Aspose.Email integrated into your project, initialize the library in your Java application. Here's how to set up a basic environment:

```java
import com.aspose.email.License;

public class EmailApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load license if available
        License license = new License();
        try {
            license.setLicense("path_to_your_aspose_email_license.lic");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("License setup failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

With your environment ready, let's move on to implementing various features using Aspose.Email for Java.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Loading EML and Saving as EML

**Overview**
This feature demonstrates how to load an EML file and save it back as an EML while preserving its original content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
import com.aspose.email.EmlLoadOptions;
import com.aspose.email.SaveOptions;

public class LoadAndSaveEML {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the EML file
        MailMessage msg = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "test.eml", new EmlLoadOptions());
        
        // Save it back as an EML
        msg.save(dataDir + "LoadAndSaveFileAsEML_out.eml", SaveOptions.getDefaultEml());
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `MailMessage.load()` method loads the EML file, and `msg.save()` writes it back to disk in its original format.

### Feature 2: Loading and Saving as EML Preserving Original Boundaries

**Overview**
Preserve the original boundaries of an EML file during save operations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.aspose.email.EmlSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessageSaveType;

public class PreserveOriginalBoundaries {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the EML file
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "test.eml");
        
        // Configure options to preserve original boundaries
        EmlSaveOptions emlSaveOptions = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.getEmlFormat());
        emlSaveOptions.setPreserveOriginalBoundaries(true);
        
        // Save the file with preserved boundaries
        eml.save(dataDir + "PreserveOriginalBoundaries_out.eml", emlSaveOptions);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Setting `setPreserveOriginalBoundaries(true)` ensures that the original content structure is maintained during saving.

### Feature 3: Saving as EML Preserving TNEF Attachments

**Overview**
Handle emails with TNEF attachments, preserving them during save operations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.aspose.email.FileCompatibilityMode;

public class PreserveTNEFAttachments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the EML file with TNEF attachments
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "PreserveOriginalBoundaries.eml");
        
        // Configure save options for TNEF preservation
        EmlSaveOptions emlSaveOptions = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.getEmlFormat());
        emlSaveOptions.setFileCompatibilityMode(FileCompatibilityMode.PreserveTnefAttachments);
        
        // Save the file with preserved TNEF attachments
        eml.save(dataDir + "PreserveTNEFAttachment_out.eml", emlSaveOptions);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Using `setFileCompatibilityMode(FileCompatibilityMode.PreserveTnefAttachments)` ensures that TNEF attachments are retained.

### Feature 4: Loading EML, Saving to MSG

**Overview**
Convert an EML file into the MSG format, commonly used in Microsoft Outlook.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.aspose.email.SaveOptions;

public class LoadEMLSaveToMSG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the EML file
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "test.eml");
        
        // Save it as an MSG file with Unicode support
        eml.save(dataDir + "LoadingEMLSavingToMSG_out.msg", SaveOptions.getDefaultMsgUnicode());
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `SaveOptions.getDefaultMsgUnicode()` ensures the MSG file is saved with full Unicode support.

### Feature 5: Saving MailMessage as MHTM

**Overview**
Convert a MailMessage object to MHTML format, ideal for web viewing.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import com.aspose.email.MhtSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessageSaveType;

public class SaveAsMHTM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the EML file
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "test.eml");
        
        // Configure save options for MHTML format
        MhtSaveOptions mhtSaveOptions = new MhtSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.getMhtmlFormat());
        
        // Save the message as MHTM with configured options
        eml.save(dataDir + "MailMessageAsMHTM_out.mhtml", mhtSaveOptions);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `MhtSaveOptions` allows saving MailMessage objects in MHTML format, which is well-suited for web applications.

### Conclusion
