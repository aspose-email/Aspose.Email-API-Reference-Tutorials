# Using Aspose.Email for Document Attachments


## Introduction to Using Aspose.Email for Document Attachments in Java

In this tutorial, we will explore how to work with document attachments using Aspose.Email for Java. Aspose.Email is a powerful Java API that allows you to manipulate email messages and their attachments with ease. We will cover the following topics:

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Email for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).

## Adding Aspose.Email to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Aspose.Email library to your Java project. Follow these steps:

1. Download the Aspose.Email for Java library from the provided link.

2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

3. In your Java project, add the Aspose.Email JAR files to your classpath. You can do this in your favorite integrated development environment (IDE) or by using the command line.

## Creating a New Email Message

Let's start by creating a new email message with a document attachment. We'll use a simple example to illustrate this:

```java
import com.aspose.email.Attachment;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

public class CreateEmailWithAttachment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new email message
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();

        // Set the sender and recipient email addresses
        message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
        message.setTo("recipient@example.com");

        // Set the subject and body of the email
        message.setSubject("Document Attachment Example");
        message.setBody("Please find the attached document.");

        // Attach a document file to the email
        Attachment attachment = new Attachment("path/to/your/document.pdf");
        message.addAttachment(attachment);

        // Save the email message to a file or send it using SMTP
        message.save("attachment_email.eml");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `MailMessage` object, set the sender and recipient email addresses, specify the subject and body of the email, and attach a document file to it.

## Retrieving Document Attachments

You may need to extract and work with document attachments from incoming emails. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.email.Attachment;
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

public class ExtractAttachments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load an email message from a file or receive it using SMTP
        MailMessage message = MailMessage.load("received_email.eml");

        // Iterate through attachments and save document attachments
        for (Attachment attachment : message.getAttachments()) {
            if (attachment.getContentType().getName().endsWith("pdf")) {
                attachment.save("document_attachment.pdf");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we load an email message from a file (you can also receive it using SMTP), iterate through the attachments, and save any document attachments with a PDF content type.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to work with document attachments using Aspose.Email for Java. You've learned how to create and send emails with document attachments and how to extract document attachments from incoming emails. Aspose.Email provides powerful capabilities for working with various types of attachments, making it a valuable tool for email automation in Java applications.

## FAQ's

### How can I send an email with multiple document attachments?

To send an email with multiple document attachments, you can simply add more `Attachment` objects to the `MailMessage` as shown in the example above. Each `Attachment` represents a separate attachment.

### Can I work with attachments other than PDF documents?

Yes, Aspose.Email for Java supports a wide range of attachment types, including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, images, and more. You can check the attachment's content type and handle it accordingly in your code.

### How do I handle large document attachments?

If you need to handle large document attachments, consider using streaming techniques to avoid loading the entire attachment into memory. Aspose.Email provides options for streaming attachments, allowing you to process them efficiently.
