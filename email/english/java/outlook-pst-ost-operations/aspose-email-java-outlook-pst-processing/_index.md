       <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
       <artifactId>aspose-email</artifactId>
       <version>25.4</version>
       <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
     </dependency>
     ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) version 16 or higher
   - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of Java programming
   - Familiarity with Maven for managing project dependencies

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for Java

## Implementation Guide

### Load Outlook PST File

#### Overview
Loading an Outlook PST file is your first step to accessing its contents programmatically. This allows you to perform operations like reading emails, extracting contacts, and more.

#### Steps

**1. Import Necessary Classes**

Start by importing the required classes from Aspose.Email:
```java
import com.aspose.email.PersonalStorage;
```

**2. Define File Path**

Specify the path where your Outlook PST file is located:
```java
String pstFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Outlook.pst";
```

**3. Load the PST File**

Load the PST using Aspose.Email's `PersonalStorage` class:
```java
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.fromFile(pstFilePath);
```

### Access Contacts Folder in PST

#### Overview
After loading the PST file, access its 'Contacts' folder to work with contact data.

#### Steps

**1. Retrieve Root Folder**

Access the root folder of your loaded PST:
```java
FolderInfo rootFolder = pst.getRootFolder();
```

**2. Get Contacts Subfolder**

Navigate to the 'Contacts' subfolder:
```java
FolderInfo contactsFolder = rootFolder.getSubFolder("Contacts");
```

### Iterate Through Contacts in PST

#### Overview
Iterating through contacts allows you to process each contact individually.

#### Steps

**1. Fetch Contact Messages**

Retrieve all messages (contacts) within the 'Contacts' folder:
```java
MessageInfoCollection messageInfoCollection = contactsFolder.getContents();
```

**2. Loop Through Contacts**

Iterate over each contact using a for-loop:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < messageInfoCollection.size(); i++) {
    MessageInfo messageInfo = (MessageInfo) messageInfoCollection.get_Item(i);
}
```

### Extract and Display Contact Information

#### Overview
Extract detailed information from each contact to use or display it.

#### Steps

**1. Extract MapiContact**

Convert the `MessageInfo` object into a `MapiContact`:
```java
MapiContact contact = (MapiContact) pst.extractMessage(messageInfo).toMapiMessageItem();
```

**2. Display Contact Details**

Extract and print out relevant contact details such as display name:
```java
String displayName = contact.getNameInfo().getDisplayName();
String entryIdString = messageInfo.getEntryIdString();
System.out.println("Display Name: " + displayName);
```

### Save Contact Information to Disk in vCard Format

#### Overview
Saving extracted contacts to disk allows for easy sharing and backup.

#### Steps

**1. Define Output Path**

Set the file path where you wish to save the contact:
```java
String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Contacts" + contact.getNameInfo().getDisplayName() + ".vcf";
```

**2. Save Contact in vCard Format**

Use `ContactSaveFormat.VCard` to save your contact:
```java
contact.save(outputPath, ContactSaveFormat.VCard);
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Email Management Systems:** Automate the organization and backup of contacts from PST files.
2. **CRM Integration:** Extract contact details for integration with Customer Relationship Management tools.
3. **Data Migration:** Facilitate seamless migration of email data between different platforms.
4. **Archiving Solutions:** Implement archiving solutions that ensure compliance and easy retrieval of contact information.

- **Optimization Tips:** Use Aspose.Email's efficient methods for reading and writing data to minimize performance overhead.
- **Java Memory Management:** Ensure proper garbage collection by managing object lifecycle effectively within your application.
