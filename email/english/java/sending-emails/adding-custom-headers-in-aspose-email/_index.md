# Adding Custom Headers in Aspose.Email


## Introduction

In the world of email communication, the ability to add custom headers to your email messages can be a valuable tool. Custom headers allow you to include additional information or metadata within your emails, which can be useful for various purposes, such as tracking, filtering, or categorizing messages.

Aspose.Email for Java provides a powerful and flexible API for working with email messages, including the capability to add custom headers to your emails. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of adding custom headers to an email message using Aspose.Email for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system. You'll need Java to compile and run the Java code examples in this guide.

2. Aspose.Email for Java Library: Download the Aspose.Email for Java library from the download link: [Aspose.Email for Java Download](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/)

   Once downloaded, add the Aspose.Email JAR files to your Java project's classpath. This library is essential for working with email messages using Aspose.Email.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to start adding custom headers to your email messages using Aspose.Email for Java. Follow the step-by-step guide in the previous section to learn how to do this.

Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide on how to add custom headers in Aspose.Email using the Aspose.Email for Java API. This guide includes source code examples.

## Step 1: Set up your Java environment

Before you start, make sure you have Java and Aspose.Email for Java properly installed and set up in your development environment.

## Step 2: Create a new Java project

Create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Step 3: Add Aspose.Email for Java library

You need to add the Aspose.Email for Java library to your project. You can do this by downloading the library from the download link provided:

[Aspose.Email for Java Download](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/)

Once downloaded, add the Aspose.Email JAR files to your project's classpath.

## Step 4: Import Aspose.Email classes

In your Java code, import the necessary Aspose.Email classes:

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;
```

## Step 5: Create an Email message

You can create an Email message using Aspose.Email. Here's an example:

```java
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.setSubject("Adding Custom Headers Example");
message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
message.setTo("recipient@example.com");
message.setHtmlBody("<p>This is a sample email with custom headers.</p>");
```

## Step 6: Add custom headers

To add custom headers to the email, you can use the `MailMessage` object's `getHeaders` method:

```java
message.getHeaders().add("X-Custom-Header1", "Value1");
message.getHeaders().add("X-Custom-Header2", "Value2");
```

You can add as many custom headers as needed.

## Step 7: Save the email

After adding custom headers, you can save the email to a file or send it using Aspose.Email's capabilities. Here's an example of saving it to a file:

```java
message.save("custom_headers_email.eml", SaveOptions.getDefaultEml());
```

## Step 8: Complete the program

Here's the complete Java program:

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;

public class AddCustomHeadersExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new email message
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
        message.setSubject("Adding Custom Headers Example");
        message.setFrom("sender@example.com");
        message.setTo("recipient@example.com");
        message.setHtmlBody("<p>This is a sample email with custom headers.</p>");

        // Add custom headers
        message.getHeaders().add("X-Custom-Header1", "Value1");
        message.getHeaders().add("X-Custom-Header2", "Value2");

        // Save the email to a file
        message.save("custom_headers_email.eml", SaveOptions.getDefaultEml());

        System.out.println("Email with custom headers saved successfully.");
    }
}
```
