## Implementation Guide

We'll explore key features of managing MAPI contacts:

### Creating and Saving a MAPI Contact

#### Overview

Create a new MAPI contact, populate it with details such as names, addresses, emails, and photos, then save it as an MSG file.

#### Implementation Steps

**1. Define the Contact's Basic Information**

Set up basic information for your contact:

```java
MapiContact contact = new MapiContact("Sebastian Wright", "SebastianWright@dayrep.com");
```

**2. Set Name and Professional Properties**

Configure additional name details and professional information:

```java
contact.setNameInfo(new MapiContactNamePropertySet("Bertha", "A.", "Buell"));
contact.setProfessionalInfo(new MapiContactProfessionalPropertySet("Awthentikz", "Social work assistant"));
```

**3. Add Personal, Address, Email, and Telephone Details**

Further personalize the contact with URLs, addresses, emails, and phone numbers:

```java
contact.getPersonalInfo().setPersonalHomePage("B2BTies.com");
contact.getPhysicalAddresses().getWorkAddress().setAddress("Im Astenfeld 59 8580 EDELSCHROTT");
contact.getElectronicAddresses().setEmail1(new MapiContactElectronicAddress("Experwas", "SMTP", "BerthaABuell@armyspy.com"));
contact.setTelephones(new MapiContactTelephonePropertySet("06605045265"));
```

**4. Load and Set a Photo**

Load an image file as the contact's photo:

```java
File fi = new File(dataDir + "Desert.jpg");
byte[] fileContent = Files.readAllBytes(fi.toPath());
MapiContactPhoto photo = new MapiContactPhoto(fileContent, MapiContactPhotoImageFormat.Jpeg);
contact.setPhoto(photo);
```

**5. Save the Contact as an MSG File**

Save your contact to a specified directory:

```java
contact.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Contact_out.msg", ContactSaveFormat.Msg);
```

### Loading a Contact from MSG

#### Overview

Load a MAPI contact from an existing MSG file.

#### Implementation Steps

**1. Load the MapiMessage**

Load your message file as a `MapiMessage` object:

```java
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.fromFile(dataDir + "messageMapi.msg");
```

**2. Convert to MAPI Contact Object**

Convert it into a `MapiContact` for further manipulation or display:

```java
MapiContact mapiContact = (MapiContact) msg.toMapiMessageItem();
```

### Loading a Contact from VCard

#### Overview

Load a contact directly from a VCF file.

#### Implementation Steps

**1. Load the MAPI Contact**

Load the contact using its VCard representation:

```java
MapiContact mapiContact = MapiContact.fromVCard(dataDir + "microsoft.vcf");
```

### Loading VCard Contact with Specified Encoding

#### Overview

Learn how to load a contact from a VCF file using specified character encoding.

#### Implementation Steps

**1. Load the Contact Using UTF-8 Encoding**

Specify the encoding for correct interpretation of characters:

```java
MapiContact contactReadFromFile = MapiContact.fromVCard(dataDir + "microsoft.vcf", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
