```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>

### License Acquisition Steps

1. **Free Trial**: Download a free trial from the [Aspose.Email Java release page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/java/).
2. **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license on their [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for extended testing.
3. **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for production use if you find it beneficial.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Initialize the library in your Java application as follows:

```java
import com.aspose.email.*;

public class EmailSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Apply license if available
        License license = new License();
        license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
        
        System.out.println("Aspose.Email for Java is ready to use!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Create a Distribution List

Creating a distribution list involves defining members and configuring properties such as subject and body.

#### Define Members of the Distribution List

Set up your document directory path and initialize the member collection:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/outlook/";
MapiDistributionListMemberCollection oneOffmembers = new MapiDistributionListMemberCollection();
oneOffmembers.addItem(new MapiDistributionListMember("John R. Patrick", "JohnRPatrick@armyspy.com"));
oneOffmembers.addItem(new MapiDistributionListMember("Tilly Bates", "TillyBates@armyspy.com"));
```

#### Create and Configure the Distribution List

Instantiate a `MapiDistributionList` object with necessary attributes:

```java
MapiDistributionList dlist = new MapiDistributionList("Simple list", oneOffmembers);
dlist.setBody("Test body");
dlist.setSubject("Test subject");
dlist.setMileage("Test mileage");
dlist.setBilling("Test billing");
```

#### Save the Distribution List

Save your distribution list to a file:

```java
dlist.save(dataDir + "distlist_out.msg");
```

### Save a Distribution List to File

This feature is straightforward once you have created your `MapiDistributionList` object.

```java
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
dlist.save(outputDir + "/distlist_out.msg");
```

## Practical Applications

- **Automating Email Campaigns**: Use this feature to automate the distribution of newsletters or promotional emails.
- **Team Communication**: Streamline team updates by sending consolidated messages to a predefined list.
- **Project Management**: Keep project stakeholders informed through periodic mailing lists.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large email distributions, consider these tips:
- Optimize memory usage by cleaning up unused objects and collections.
