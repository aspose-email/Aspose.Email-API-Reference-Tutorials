#### Metered License Application
This feature allows you to apply a metered license, ideal for tracking usage across multiple instances or users.
```java
import com.aspose.email.Metered;

public class ApplyMeteredLicense {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create an instance of the Metered class
        Metered metered = new Metered();

        // Set your unique metered key
        metered.setMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
        
        // Links your application to a metering server for accurate usage tracking.
    }
}
```
**Parameters Explanation:**
- `setMeteredKey`: Configures your public and private keys for metering.

#### Load Email Document
Efficiently loading emails from disk or network locations is vital. Here’s how you can do it with Aspose.Email:
```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;
import com.aspose.email.examples.Utils;

public class LoadEmailDocument {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define the path to your email documents
        String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(LoadEmailDocument.class) + "email/";

        // Load an email document from a specified directory
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load(dataDir + "test.eml");
    }
}
```
**Key Notes:**
- `MailMessage.load()`: Loads your email file into the application, ready for manipulation.

#### Retrieve Email Subject
Extracting information like the subject from an email is essential for sorting and processing:
```java
import com.aspose.email.MailMessage;

public class RetrieveEmailSubject {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Assume 'eml' is a MailMessage object already loaded
        MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/email/test.eml");

        // Retrieve and print the email's subject
        String subject = eml.getSubject();
        
        // Use the subject line for categorizing or searching emails.
    }
}
```
