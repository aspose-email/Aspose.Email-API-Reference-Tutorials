## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into several key features.

### Creating and Saving Calendar Items

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to programmatically create a calendar item, such as an appointment, and save it in ICS format. This is ideal for integrating scheduling functionality into your Java applications.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Initialize MapiCalendar:**
   Begin by creating an instance of `MapiCalendar` to represent the appointment.

   ```java
   MapiCalendar appointment = new MapiCalendar();
   ```

2. **Set Appointment Details:**
   Define the location, subject, and body for your appointment.

   ```java
   appointment.setLocation("LAKE ARGYLE WA 6743");
   appointment.setSubject("Appointment");
   appointment.setBody("This is a very important meeting");
   ```

3. **Define Start and End Dates:**
   Use `GregorianCalendar` to set the start and end dates for your appointment.

   ```java
   Calendar cal = GregorianCalendar.getInstance();
   cal.set(2016, 10, 2); // Month is zero-based.
   Date startDate = cal.getTime();

   cal.setTime(startDate);
   cal.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1); // End date is one day later.
   Date endDate = cal.getTime();

   appointment.setStartDate(startDate);
   appointment.setEndDate(endDate);
   ```

4. **Save the Appointment:**
   Save your calendar item in ICS format to a specified directory.

   ```java
   String dataDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
   appointment.save(dataDir + "CalendarItem_out.ics\
