# Aspose.Email Tutorials: Master Email Management & Manipulation with .NET & Java APIs

If you need to **create calendar appointment** programmatically, send email from C#, convert PST files to EML, validate email addresses, apply digital signatures, or parse email headers, you’ve come to the right place. This hub gathers every essential Aspose.Email tutorial for both **C# .NET** and **Java** developers, giving you a one‑stop reference to accelerate your projects and deliver reliable email‑centric features.

## How to create calendar appointment with Aspose.Email

Creating a meeting request or calendar entry is a common requirement for scheduling systems, CRM platforms, and automated notification services. Aspose.Email provides a fluent API that lets you build a fully‑featured appointment—complete with attendees, reminders, recurrence patterns, and time‑zone handling—without leaving your .NET or Java codebase.

Below you’ll find dedicated tutorials that walk you through every step, from constructing the `Appointment` object to saving it as an Outlook‑compatible file (ICS, MSG, or PST). Whether you’re building a corporate scheduler or a simple reminder app, these guides give you the exact code you need.

## How to send email C# with Aspose.Email

Sending email reliably from a C# application often involves handling authentication, MIME formatting, and attachment management. Our **send email C#** tutorials demonstrate how to configure SMTP clients, embed images, and secure your messages with TLS/SSL—all using the Aspose.Email library.

## Convert PST to EML using Aspose.Email

Migrating legacy Outlook archives to a more portable format? Learn how to **convert PST to EML** efficiently, preserving folder structures, attachments, and metadata. The step‑by‑step guides show you how to open a PST file, iterate through its messages, and export each one as an independent EML file.

## Validate email address .NET

Ensuring that user‑entered email addresses are syntactically correct and belong to a real domain can save you from bounced messages. Our **validate email address .NET** tutorials cover regular‑expression checks, DNS MX lookups, and integration with Aspose.Email’s built‑in validator.

## Email digital signatures

Protect the integrity and authenticity of your outgoing messages with **email digital signatures**. The tutorials explain how to sign messages using X.509 certificates, verify signatures on received mail, and handle common pitfalls such as certificate chain validation.

## Parse email headers

When dealing with inbound messages, extracting routing information, spam scores, or custom metadata often requires **parsing email headers**. We provide clear examples that show how to read, modify, and analyze headers using Aspose.Email’s robust API.
