### Create AMP Email with Basic Structure

#### Overview
Creating a basic structure is the foundation of any AMP email. This section demonstrates how to set up an initial HTML body.

**1. Initialize AmpMessage**
Start by creating an instance of `AmpMessage`.
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Amp;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
AmpMessage msg = new AmpMessage();
```

**2. Set the HTML Body**
Assign a simple HTML content to `HtmlBody`.
```csharp
msg.HtmlBody = "<html><body> Hello AMP </body></html>";
msg.Save(dataDir + "BasicAmpEmail.eml");
```

#### Key Configuration
Ensure your directory path is correctly set up to save files successfully.
