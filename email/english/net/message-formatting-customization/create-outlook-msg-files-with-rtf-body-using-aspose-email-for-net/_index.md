## Implementation Guide
### Creating MSG Files with RTF Body
This section explains how to convert an HTML-based email into an Outlook-compatible MSG format using Aspose.Email for .NET.
#### Step 1: Define Directories and File Paths
First, specify the directories where your input data and output files will be stored:
```csharp
string dataDir = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Outlook");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "CreatingMSGFilesWithRTFBody_out.msg");
```
#### Step 2: Constructing the Email Message
Create an instance of `MailMessage` and set its properties such as sender, recipient, subject, and HTML body:
```csharp
// Create a new MailMessage object
MailMessage mailMsg = new MailMessage();

// Set essential email properties
mailMsg.From = "from@domain.com";
mailMsg.To = "to@domain.com";
mailMsg.Subject = "subject";
mailMsg.HtmlBody = "<h3>rtf example</h3><p>creating an <b><u>outlook message (msg)</u></b> file using Aspose.Email.</p>";
```
#### Step 3: Converting MailMessage to MapiMessage
To convert the `MailMessage` into a format compatible with Outlook MSG files, use the following code:
```csharp
// Convert the MailMessage to a MapiMessage object
MapiMessage outlookMsg = MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(mailMsg);
```
#### Step 4: Saving the MSG File
Finally, save the `MapiMessage` as an MSG file in your specified directory:
```csharp
// Save the message as an .msg file
outlookMsg.Save(outputFile);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure you have the correct permissions to write files in the output directory.
- Verify that Aspose.Email is properly installed and referenced in your project.
