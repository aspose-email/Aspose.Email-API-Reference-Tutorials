- .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later installed on your machine.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with handling email protocols and MIME messages will be beneficial but not necessary.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

Before we start modifying email addresses, let's set up Aspose.Email in your project. Here are the steps you can follow using different package managers:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Package Manager Console (NuGet)**

```
This basic setup prepares you for leveraging the powerful features of Aspose.Email.

## Implementation Guide

### Modifying Email Addresses

Let's dive into how you can change email addresses in a C# application using Aspose.Email.

#### Loading and Modifying an Email Message

First, we need to load an existing email message. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
// Load the email message from a file
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load("path/to/test.eml");
```

#### Adding "To" Address with Friendly Name

You can specify a friendly name for the recipient like this:
```csharp
// Add or modify the 'To' address with a friendly name
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("kyle@to.com", "Kyle Huang"));
```
This feature is useful for personalizing emails and ensuring clarity in your message headers.

#### Adding "CC" and "Bcc" Addresses

Similarly, you can add CC and BCC addresses:
```csharp
// Add 'Cc' address with a friendly name
message.CC.Add(new MailAddress("guangzhou@cc.com", "Guangzhou Team"));

// Add 'Bcc' address with a friendly name
message.Bcc.Add(new MailAddress("ahaq@bcc.com", "Ammad ulHaq"));
```

#### Saving the Modified Email

After making changes, save your email message:
```csharp
// Save the updated email to an output file
message.Save("path/to/MessageWithFriendlyName_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure that the paths for loading and saving files are correct.
- If you encounter issues with MIME formatting, verify your message content before making changes.

## Practical Applications

Here are some practical use cases where modifying email addresses is beneficial:
1. **Bulk Email Updates**: Automatically update recipient lists based on dynamic data inputs or user actions.
2. **Email Marketing Campaigns**: Personalize emails by adding names to CC and BCC fields for better engagement tracking.
3. **Internal Communication Systems**: Use friendly names in corporate communications to enhance readability.
4. **Automated Notifications**: Update notification emails with relevant team members' addresses dynamically.

## Performance Considerations

When working with email operations, consider these performance tips:
- Minimize the number of times you load and save messages within loops by batching operations where possible.
- Be mindful of memory usage when handling large batches of emails. Dispose of `MailMessage` objects properly to free resources.
- Use asynchronous methods if available for network operations to prevent blocking calls.

## Conclusion

You’ve now learned how to modify email addresses in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET, complete with friendly names for recipients. This functionality opens up numerous possibilities for enhancing your email processing tasks.

To take this further, explore additional features of Aspose.Email such as attachments handling and calendar integration. Implement these techniques in your projects to see their full potential.

**Next Steps**: Try integrating these modifications into a larger system or application to better understand their practical applications.
