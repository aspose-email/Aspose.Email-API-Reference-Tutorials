## Implementation Guide

Let's explore the key features provided by Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Setting an HTML Body in Email Message

**Overview:** Creating a rich HTML body allows you to craft visually appealing email content with formatting, images, and links.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Create a New MailMessage Object**

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

// Initialize the mail message object
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

**2. Set HTML Body Content**

```csharp
// Define the HTML body
message.HtmlBody = "<html><body>This is the HTML body</body></html>";
```
- **Parameters Explained:** `HtmlBody` takes a string representing the HTML content of your email.

### Converting Email to MHTML Format

**Overview:** Converting emails to MHTML format allows for single-file representations that include all resources, facilitating archiving and display purposes.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Create and Configure MailMessage**

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Mht;
using System.IO;

// Initialize the mail message with sender and recipient details
MailMessage mailMsg = new MailMessage("from@example.com", "to@example.com");
mailMsg.Subject = "Email Subject";
mailMsg.Body = "This is the body of the email.";
```

**2. Convert to MHTML**

```csharp
// Prepare a memory stream for output
MemoryStream mhtmlStream = new MemoryStream();

// Save the message in MHTML format
mailMsg.Save(mhtmlStream, SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml);
```
- **Key Configuration:** `SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml` ensures all resources are included in the conversion.

### Loading and Displaying Email Properties

**Overview:** Loading an email file and displaying its properties is useful for debugging or data extraction purposes.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Load an Email File**

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Load the email from a specified path
MailMessage loadedEmail = MailMessage.Load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\example.eml");
```

**2. Display Email Properties**

```csharp
// Output the subject and sender's address to the console
Console.WriteLine(loadedEmail.Subject);
Console.WriteLine(loadedEmail.From.Address);
```
- **Parameters Explained:** `Load` reads an email file, while properties like `Subject` and `From` can be accessed directly.
