In this tutorial, we'll explore how to export email messages to EML format using C# with Aspose.Email for .NET. EML files are widely used for storing and archiving email messages, making this process essential for various applications.

- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Email for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Load the Source Email Message

First, load the source email message from a .msg file:
```csharp
string sourcePath = "path/to/source/email.msg";
MailMessage email = MailMessage.Load(sourcePath);
```

## Step 2: Set Properties from the Loaded Email

Next, set properties from the loaded email message to a new EML message object:
```csharp
emlMessage.Subject = email.Subject;
emlMessage.From = email.From;
emlMessage.To = email.To;
emlMessage.Body = email.Body;
// Set other properties as needed
```

## Step 3: Handle Attachments

Iterate through attachments in the original email and add them to the new EML message:
```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in email.Attachments)
{
    emlMessage.Attachments.Add(attachment);
}
```

## Step 4: Add Additional Metadata

Include any additional metadata or custom headers to the EML message:
```csharp
emlMessage.Headers.Add("X-Custom-Header", "Custom Value");
```

## Step 5: Save the EML File

Finally, save the EML file to a specified output path:
```csharp
string outputPath = "path/to/output/eml.eml";
emlMessage.Save(outputPath, SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
Console.WriteLine("Email exported successfully.");
```
