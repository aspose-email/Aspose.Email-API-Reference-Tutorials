# Draft Message Handling in C# - Saving Email as Draft


## Introduction

Draft message handling is a crucial functionality for email clients. Users often need the ability to start composing an email, save it as a draft, and return to it later for further editing or eventual sending. This article demonstrates how to implement this feature using the Aspose.Email for .NET library.

// Set email subject
draft.Subject = "Draft Email Demo";
```

## Composing Email Body

```csharp
// Set email body
draft.Body = new TextBody("Hello, this is a draft email.");
```

## Saving as Draft

```csharp
// Save the email as a draft
draft.Save("draft.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

To load and edit draft messages, follow these steps:

```csharp
// Load a draft email
MailMessage loadedDraft = MailMessage.Load("draft.eml");

// Edit recipients
loadedDraft.To.Clear();
loadedDraft.To.Add("newrecipient@example.com");
