# Converting EML to MSG Format using C#


## Introduction

In today's digital world, where email communication plays a pivotal role, the ability to manipulate different email formats efficiently becomes crucial. EML and MSG are two common formats used for storing email messages. EML is widely used for exporting and archiving individual emails, while MSG is more suitable for storing emails along with their attachments. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of converting EML files to MSG format using C# and Aspose.Email for .NET, a powerful library for handling email-related tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Visual Studio or any C# development environment
- Aspose.Email for .NET library (download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net)

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new C# project in your preferred development environment.
2. Install the Aspose.Email for .NET library by adding the reference to it.

## Step 2: Writing the Conversion Code

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Storage;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Load the EML file
        string emlFilePath = "path_to_your_eml_file.eml";
        MailMessage emlMessage = MailMessage.Load(emlFilePath);

        // Save the message in MSG format
        string msgFilePath = "converted_message.msg";
        emlMessage.Save(msgFilePath, SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
        
        Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully!");
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Explanation

- We start by importing necessary namespaces from the Aspose.Email library.
- In the `Main` method, we load the EML file using `MailMessage.Load` method.
- Then, we save the loaded message in MSG format using the `Save` method and specifying the desired format.

## Step 4: Running the Code

1. Replace `"path_to_your_eml_file.eml"` with the actual path of your EML file.
2. Run the code.
