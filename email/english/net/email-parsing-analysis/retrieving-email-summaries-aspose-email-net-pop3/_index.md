### Retrieve Message Summary Information Using Unique ID
#### Overview
Fetch essential information like subject and date without downloading the entire message, ideal for quick email scans.

#### Steps
**Step 1: Define Server Details**
Specify your POP3 server details:
```csharp
string host = "host.domain.com"; // Replace with actual host domain
int port = 456; // Correct port number
string username = "username"; // Actual username
string password = "password"; // Actual password
```
