## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down how to retrieve read and delivery receipt information.

### Retrieving Receipt Information

#### Overview:
This feature allows you to extract and analyze whether your sent emails have been opened or delivered successfully.

#### Step 1: Load the Email Message
Begin by loading a `.msg` file that contains the email message. This is where we start our journey into retrieving receipt information.

**Code Snippet:**
```csharp
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "\TestMessage.msg");
```

#### Step 2: Iterate Over Recipients
For each recipient, check the status of read and delivery receipts.

**Accessing Recipient Information:**
```csharp
foreach (MapiRecipient recipient in msg.Recipients)
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Recipient: {0}", recipient.DisplayName));
    
    // Check for receipt information
    if (recipient.MessageStatus == MapiMessageStatus.Read && recipient.ReceiptType == MapiRecipientReceiptType.Read)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Read Receipt Received.");
    }

    if (recipient.MessageStatus == MapiMessageStatus.Delivered)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Delivery Receipt Received.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **MapiMessage.FromFile**: Loads the message from a specified file.
- **msg.Recipients**: Provides access to each recipient's details.
- **MessageStatus and ReceiptType**: Used to determine receipt status.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure that your `.msg` files are correctly formatted and accessible.
