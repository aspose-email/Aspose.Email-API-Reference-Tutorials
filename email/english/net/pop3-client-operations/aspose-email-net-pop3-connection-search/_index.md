```

## Implementation Guide
We will cover two main features: connecting to a POP3 server and searching emails with case-sensitive filters.

### Feature 1: Connect and Log in to POP3

#### Overview:
Connecting to a POP3 server is the first step in managing your email programmatically. Aspose.Email for .NET simplifies this process, allowing you to integrate email functionalities into your applications effortlessly.

**Step 1: Define Connection Parameters**
Create a class that encapsulates connection details and initializes `Pop3Client`.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Pop3;

namespace Pop3ConnectionExample
{
    public class ConnectAndLoginPOP3
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // Define connection parameters
            const string host = "your.pop3.host.com";     // Specify the POP3 server host
            const int port = 110;                         // Default POP3 port number
            const string username = "user@host.com";      // Your email address
            const string password = "password";           // Password for your email account

            // Create a Pop3Client instance with defined parameters
            Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client(host, port, username, password);
            
            // Optionally: Check the connection status
            if (client.Connected)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Connected to POP3 server successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- **Host**: The address of your POP3 server.
- **Port**: Typically 110 for non-secure connections or 995 for secure ones.
- **Username and Password**: Credentials for authenticating with the server.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure that firewall settings allow connections to the specified port.
- Verify correct credentials and server details are provided.
- Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

### Feature 2: Apply Case-Sensitive Filters to Search Emails

#### Overview:
Searching emails based on specific criteria is crucial for many applications. Aspose.Email allows you to apply case-sensitive filters, enhancing search precision.

**Step 1: Connect and Authenticate**
Ensure `Pop3Client` is already set up as shown in Feature 1.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Tools.Search;

namespace EmailSearchExample
{
    public class CaseSensitiveEmailSearch
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // Assume Pop3Client is connected and authenticated
            Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client("your.pop3.host.com", 110, "user@host.com", "password");

            try
            {
                // Create a MailQueryBuilder instance
                MailQueryBuilder builder1 = new MailQueryBuilder();

                // Add a case-sensitive filter for emails from 'tesT'
                builder1.From.Contains("tesT", true);

                // Get the query based on the builder's configuration
                MailQuery query1 = builder1.GetQuery();
                
                // List messages that match the query criteria
                Pop3MessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol1 = client.ListMessages(query1);
                
                Console.WriteLine($"Found {messageInfoCol1.Count} emails matching the criteria.");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error searching emails: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- **Case Sensitivity**: Set to `true` for exact case matches.
- **Query Builder**: Facilitates the creation of complex queries easily.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure network connectivity when accessing the server.
- Handle exceptions to avoid application crashes during email search operations.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where these features can be applied:

1. **Automated Email Filtering**: Automatically categorize incoming emails based on sender or subject using case-sensitive searches.
2. **Email Archiving Solutions**: Connect and download specific emails for archiving purposes, ensuring sensitive information is accurately identified.
