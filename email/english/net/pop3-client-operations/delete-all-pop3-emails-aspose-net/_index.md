### Creating a POP3 Client
**Overview**: This section demonstrates how to create and configure a POP3 client using Aspose.Email for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Initialize the Pop3Client**
   Begin by specifying your email server details, including host, port, username, and password.

   ```csharp
   // Create a POP3 client instance with server credentials.
   Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client("mail.aspose.com", 110, "username", "password");
   ```

2. **Understanding Parameters**
   - `host`: Your email provider's host address (e.g., "mail.aspose.com").
   - `port`: The port number used by your server for POP3 connections.
   - `username` & `password`: Credentials to access the mailbox.

### Deleting All Emails
**Overview**: Learn how to delete all emails from your POP3 server using Aspose.Email for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Delete Messages**
   Use a try-catch block to safely attempt deletion of all messages in the mailbox.

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       // Attempt to delete all messages.
       client.DeleteMessages();
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
       // Handle exceptions here, such as logging or user notification.
