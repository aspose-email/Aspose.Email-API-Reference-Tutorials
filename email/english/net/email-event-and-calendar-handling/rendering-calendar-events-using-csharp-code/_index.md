# Rendering Calendar Events using C# Code



In today's digital age, managing calendar events efficiently is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. Aspose.Email for .NET provides a powerful set of tools to work with calendar events and make the most of your scheduling needs. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of rendering calendar events using C# code with Aspose.Email for .NET.

## Introduction to Aspose.Email for .NET

Before we dive into the code and its implementation, let's briefly introduce Aspose.Email for .NET. It's a robust API that allows developers to create, manipulate, and manage email messages and calendar events in various formats. With Aspose.Email, you can seamlessly work with Outlook PST files, Exchange Server, and other email-related tasks. In this tutorial, we will focus on its calendar event rendering capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you start coding, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Email for .NET: You can download the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).

2. C# Development Environment: You need a C# development environment set up on your machine.

3. Calendar Event File: Have a sample calendar event file ready. In this tutorial, we'll use "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg."

## Setting Up the Code

Let's start by setting up the C# code to render calendar events.

```csharp
// The path to the File directory.
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
string fileName = "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg";
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + fileName);
MhtSaveOptions options = new MhtSaveOptions();
{
    options.MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader | MhtFormatOptions.RenderCalendarEvent;

    // Format the output details if required - optional

    // Set the display for Start Property
    if (options.FormatTemplates.ContainsKey(MhtTemplateName.Start))
        options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.Start] = @"<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>"; 
    else
        options.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Start, @"<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");

    // Continue setting display for other properties...
};

msg.Save(dataDir + "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.mhtml", options);
```

## Understanding the Code

Now, let's break down the code and understand each part:

- We start by loading the calendar event file ("Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg") using the `MailMessage.Load` method.

- We create an `MhtSaveOptions` object to specify how we want to save the output.

- In the `options.MhtFormatOptions`, we specify that we want to render calendar event information.

- We then have the option to format the output details for various properties like Start, End, Recurrence, RecurrencePattern, Organizer, and RequiredAttendees.

- Finally, we save the rendered calendar event as an MHTML file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to render calendar events using C# code with Aspose.Email for .NET. Aspose.Email provides a straightforward and efficient way to work with calendar events, making it an excellent choice for managing scheduling tasks in your applications.
