## Implementation Guide

### Saving an Outlook MSG File as a Template (OFT Format)

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to save an Outlook MSG file directly as a template, simplifying repetitive email creation tasks.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Create the MapiMessage Object**
   
   Create a new `MapiMessage` instance with your desired sender, recipient, subject, and body.
   
   ```csharp
   using (MapiMessage mapi = new MapiMessage("test@from.to", "test@to.to", "template subject", "Template body"))
   {
       string oftMapiFileName = System.IO.Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "mapiToOft.msg");
       
       mapi.SaveAsTemplate(oftMapiFileName);
   }
   ```

2. **Parameters and Configuration:**
   - `SaveAsTemplate` is used to save the message in the OFT format, essential for template creation.
   - Ensure you specify a valid directory path where the file will be saved.

### Loading a MSG File into MapiMessage

**Overview:**
Loading existing MSG files into your application enables programmatic manipulation or reading of email data.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Load the MSG File**
   
   Use `MapiMessage.FromFile` to load an MSG file into a `MapiMessage` object.
   
   ```csharp
   string msgFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.msg");
   MapiMessage loadedMsg = MapiMessage.FromFile(msgFilePath);
   ```

2. **Accessing Message Properties**
   
   Once loaded, access various properties like subject and body.
   
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Subject: " + loadedMsg.Subject);
   Console.WriteLine("Body: " + loadedMsg.Body);
   ```

### Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where these features shine:
1. **Automated Email Campaigns**: Quickly generate and customize email templates for marketing campaigns.
2. **Customer Service Automation**: Create standardized responses or requests to enhance customer interaction.
3. **Internal Communication Templates**: Streamline internal notifications by using predefined templates.

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of `MapiMessage` objects promptly after use to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: When dealing with multiple files, process them in batches to minimize memory footprint.
