## Implementation Guide

We will explore three main features of PST file management using Aspose.Email for .NET: creating and deleting PST files, adding messages to a PST folder, and searching messages within a PST file.

### Create and Delete PST Files

This feature illustrates how you can create a new PST file or delete an existing one if it already exists. Let's break down the steps:

#### Overview
Creating and managing PST files is essential when setting up email storage from scratch or maintaining data integrity by removing outdated files.

#### Steps

**1. Define Paths**
Set the path for your output directory where the PST files will be stored.
```csharp
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Check File Existence**
Verify if a PST file already exists and delete it to avoid duplication.
```csharp
string pstFilePath = Path.Combine(outputPath, "Example_out.pst");
if (File.Exists(pstFilePath))
{
    File.Delete(pstFilePath);
    Console.WriteLine("Existing PST file deleted.");
}
```

**3. Create New PST File**
Use the Aspose.Email library to create a new PST file with an Inbox folder.
```csharp
using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.Create(pstFilePath, FileFormatVersion.Unicode))
{
    FolderInfo inboxFolder = personalStorage.CreatePredefinedFolder("Inbox\
