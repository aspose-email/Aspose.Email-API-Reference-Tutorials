### Reading and Converting OST/PST Files (H2)

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to load an Outlook file in PST format and retrieve its format details.

##### Load the Outlook File
To begin with, define your document directory path and load the Outlook file:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;

// Define your document directory path
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Load the Outlook file from the specified directory
string path = dataDir + "/PersonalStorage.pst";
PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.FromFile(path);
```

##### Retrieve and Display Format
Once loaded, you can easily retrieve and display the format of your PST file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Display Format: " + pst.Format);
```

**Explanation**: 
- **`PersonalStorage.FromFile`**: Loads the specified PST file into memory.
- **`pst.Format`**: Retrieves the format of the loaded PST file, allowing you to understand its structure.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your document path is correctly specified; otherwise, a `FileNotFoundException` may occur.
