## Implementation Guide

### Moving a Specific Subfolder from Inbox to Deleted Items

#### Overview
This feature allows you to relocate an entire subfolder within the Outlook PST file directly into the Deleted Items folder.

**Step 1: Accessing Predefined Folders**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual directory path

using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir + "/Outlook_1.pst"))
{
    FolderInfo inbox = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
    FolderInfo deleted = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);

    // Ensure the subfolder exists
    if (inbox != null && deleted != null)
    {
        FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.GetSubFolder("YourSubfolderName");
```

**Step 2: Moving the Subfolder**
```csharp
        if (subfolder != null)
        {
            personalStorage.MoveItem(subfolder, deleted);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Why Move a Subfolder?**: This helps declutter your inbox by isolating specific emails into the Deleted Items folder.

### Moving an Individual Message

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates moving a single email from any subfolder directly to the Deleted Items folder, enabling precise management of individual messages.

**Step 1: Retrieve Messages**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir + "/Outlook_1.pst"))
{
    FolderInfo inbox = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
    FolderInfo deleted = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);

    if (inbox != null && deleted != null)
    {
        FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.GetSubFolder("YourSubfolderName");
```

**Step 2: Move a Message**
```csharp
        if (subfolder != null)
        {
            MessageInfoCollection contents = subfolder.GetContents();
            
            // Move the first message as an example
            personalStorage.MoveItem(contents[0], deleted);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Why Move Individual Messages?**: This is ideal for quickly removing or archiving specific emails without deleting the entire folder.

### Moving All Subfolders

#### Overview
This feature allows transferring all subfolders within a predefined folder like Inbox to the Deleted Items folder at once.

**Step 1: Access and Prepare**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir + "/Outlook_1.pst"))
{
    FolderInfo inbox = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
    FolderInfo deleted = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);

    if (inbox != null && deleted != null)
```

**Step 2: Execute Move**
```csharp
    {
        // Move all subfolders from Inbox to Deleted Items
        inbox.MoveSubfolders(deleted);
    }
}
```
- **Why Move All Subfolders?**: This is useful for bulk operations when you need to clear out multiple folders efficiently.

### Moving All Contents of a Subfolder

#### Overview
This feature focuses on relocating every item within a specific subfolder to the Deleted Items folder, maintaining organization without manual selection.

**Step 1: Access the Target Subfolder**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Storage.Pst;
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir + "/Outlook_1.pst"))
{
    FolderInfo inbox = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);
    FolderInfo deleted = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.DeletedItems);

    if (inbox != null && deleted != null)
    {
        FolderInfo subfolder = inbox.GetSubFolder("YourSubfolderName");
```

**Step 2: Move All Contents**
```csharp
        if (subfolder != null)
        {
            // Transfer all contents to Deleted Items
            subfolder.MoveContents(deleted);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Why Move Entire Subfolder Content?**: This approach is perfect when you need to clear a folder without leaving any messages behind.

## Practical Applications

1. **Email Cleanup:** Automatically archive spam or irrelevant emails into the Deleted Items.
2. **Data Migration:** Efficiently transfer organizational data during system upgrades or migrations.
3. **Backup Purposes:** Move essential emails to backup locations while clearing redundant ones from active folders.
4. **Compliance Management:** Organize emails in preparation for audits by moving them to designated compliance folders.

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing:** When dealing with large volumes of data, consider processing in batches to avoid memory overflow.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Regularly monitor application resource usage and optimize code as needed.
- **Garbage Collection:** Utilize .NET's garbage collection effectively to manage memory when handling large PST files.
