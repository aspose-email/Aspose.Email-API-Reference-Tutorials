## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into clear steps.

### Adding a Voting Button to an Existing Outlook Message
This feature allows adding interactive elements, such as voting options, directly within email content.

#### Step 1: Load the MapiMessage
Load your existing message from disk:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
MapiMessage mapi = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/message.msg");
```

#### Step 2: Add a Voting Button
Use `FollowUpManager.AddVotingButton` to add a voting button with your desired title:

```csharp
// Adding a voting button titled "Indeed!"
FollowUpManager.AddVotingButton(mapi, "Indeed!");
```

#### Step 3: Save the Modified Message
Save the message back to disk with changes applied:

```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
mapi.Save(outputDir + "/AddVotingButtonToExistingMessage_out.msg");
```

### Loading and Manipulating Outlook Messages
In addition to adding voting buttons, you can manipulate messages for various purposes.

#### Step 1: Load the MapiMessage
Load your message:

```csharp
MapiMessage mapi = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/message.msg");
```

#### Step 2: Modify Message Properties
Update properties as needed, such as the subject:

```csharp
mapi.Subject = "Updated Subject - Voting Button Added";
```

#### Step 3: Save Changes
Save your updated message back to disk if necessary:

```csharp
mapi.Save(dataDir + "/UpdatedMessage_out.msg");
```

## Practical Applications
