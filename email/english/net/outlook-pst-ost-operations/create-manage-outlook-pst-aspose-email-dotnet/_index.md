## Implementation Guide

### Creating a New PST File

**Overview**: This section demonstrates how to create a new Outlook Personal Storage Table (PST) file in Unicode format for compatibility and efficiency.

#### Steps:
1. **Define the File Path:**
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "new_pst_out.pst");
   ```
2. **Check for Existing File:**
   Ensure no existing file is in your target directory to avoid conflicts:
   ```csharp
   if (File.Exists(dataDir)) {
       File.Delete(dataDir);
   }
   ```
3. **Create the PST:**
   Initialize a new PST file using Unicode format, which supports broader character sets.
   ```csharp
   PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.Create(dataDir, FileFormatVersion.Unicode);
   ```

### Adding a Folder to PST

**Overview**: Learn how to add subfolders like 'Inbox' to an existing PST file for better organization.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Existing PST:**
   ```csharp
   if (File.Exists(dataDir)) {
       PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir);
   }
   ```
2. **Add Subfolder:**
   Add a new folder, such as 'Inbox', under the root.
   ```csharp
   personalStorage.RootFolder.AddSubFolder("Inbox");
   ```

### Adding Messages to a Folder in PST

**Overview**: This section illustrates adding messages to an existing 'Inbox' folder within your PST file.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Existing PST and Message File:**
   Ensure both files are accessible:
   ```csharp
   if (File.Exists(dataDir)) {
       PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir);
   }
   string msgFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "MapiMsgWithPoll.msg");
   ```
2. **Select the Folder and Add Messages:**
   Retrieve 'Inbox' folder and add a message:
   ```csharp
   FolderInfo inboxFolder = personalStorage.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("Inbox");
   MapiMessage mapiMsg = MapiMessage.FromFile(msgFilePath);
   inboxFolder.AddMessage(mapiMsg);
   ```
