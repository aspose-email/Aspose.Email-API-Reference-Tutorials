## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll break down each feature into actionable steps to guide you through managing PST files with ease.

### Feature 1: Load and Access PST File
#### Overview
Loading a PST file is the first step in managing its contents. This process allows access to various folders within the file for further operations.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**Step 1**: Set Your Document Directory
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\Sub.pst";
```

**Step 2**: Load the PST File
Use the `FromFile` method to load your Outlook PST file:
```csharp
PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.FromFile(dataDir);
```

**Step 3**: Access Sent Items Folder
Retrieve specific folders like 'Sent Items' using predefined constants:
```csharp
FolderInfo sentItemsFolder = personalStorage.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.SentItems);
```

### Feature 2: Read Messages from Folder
#### Overview
Reading messages allows you to inspect the contents of a PST folder, such as retrieving email subjects.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**Step 1**: Retrieve All Messages
Access all message entries in your specified folder:
```csharp
MessageInfoCollection messages = sentItemsFolder.GetContents();
```

**Step 2**: Display Message Subjects
Loop through each message to display its subject and entry ID:
```csharp
foreach (MessageInfo message in messages)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message.Subject + ": " + message.EntryIdString);
}
```

### Feature 3: Delete Specific Messages from Folder
#### Overview
Deleting specific emails based on conditions is crucial for email management.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**Step 1**: Identify Messages to Delete
Loop through messages and check if they meet your deletion criteria:
```csharp
foreach (MessageInfo message in messages)
{
    if (message.Subject.Equals("some delete condition"))
    {
        // Proceed with deletion
    }
}
```

**Step 2**: Delete the Message
Remove the message from the folder using its Entry ID:
```csharp
sentItemsFolder.DeleteChildItem(message.EntryId);
Console.WriteLine("Deleted message with subject: " + message.Subject);
```
