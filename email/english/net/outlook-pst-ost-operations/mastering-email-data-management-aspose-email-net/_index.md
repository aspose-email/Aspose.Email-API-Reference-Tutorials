### Feature 1: Load OLM File

**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to load an OLM file using Aspose.Email, setting up the foundation for further operations.

#### Steps:

**Define Document Directory:**
Begin by specifying the path where your document is stored. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory path on your system.
```csharp
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string olmFilePath = dataDir + "/SampleOLM.olm"; // Specify the OLM file name
```
**Load the File:**
Use `OlmStorage` to load the OLM file. This object allows you to interact with the email storage.
```csharp
using (OlmStorage storage = new OlmStorage(olmFilePath))
{
    // The OLM storage is now loaded and ready for further operations.
}
```

### Feature 2: Extract Messages from Folder

**Overview:** Learn how to extract and display messages stored in folders within an OLM file.

#### Steps:
**Iterate Over Folders:**
Check each folder in the hierarchy and process if it contains messages.
```csharp
foreach (OlmFolder folder in storage.FolderHierarchy)
{
    if (folder.HasMessages)
    {
        // Process each message in this folder
        foreach (MapiMessage msg in storage.EnumerateMessages(folder))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: " + msg.Subject);
        }
    }
}
```

### Feature 3: Read Subfolders

**Overview:** This feature shows how to navigate and read sub-folders within an OLM file.

#### Steps:
**Access Sub-Folders:**
Iterate through each folder's sub-folders and display their names.
```csharp
foreach (OlmFolder folder in storage.FolderHierarchy)
{
    if (folder.SubFolders.Count > 0)
    {
        foreach (OlmFolder sub_folder in folder.SubFolders)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subfolder: " + sub_folder.Name);
        }
    }
}
```
