# C# Approach - Extracting Decoded Header Values


In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of using Aspose.Email for .NET to extract decoded header values from email messages. Aspose.Email for .NET is a robust library that empowers developers to work with various aspects of email messages, including reading and manipulating email headers.

## Step 1: Download and Install Aspose.Email for .NET

Before we begin, ensure that you have Aspose.Email for .NET installed. If you haven't already, you can download the library from the following link: [Download Aspose.Email for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net).

## Step 2: Create a New C# Project

Start by creating a new C# project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor.

## Step 3: Add a Reference to Aspose.Email

In order to use Aspose.Email in your project, you need to add a reference to the `Aspose.Email` assembly. Here's how:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Add" > "Reference."
3. In the "Reference Manager" window, click "Browse" or "Browse..." and navigate to the location where you installed Aspose.Email.
4. Choose the appropriate assembly for your project (for example, `Aspose.Email.dll`) and click "Add."

## Step 4: Extract Decoded Header Values

Now let's dive into the code to extract decoded header values from an email message. In this example, we will focus on extracting the "Subject" header.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Load the email message
		MailMessage mailMessage = MailMessage.Load("path/to/your/email.eml");
		string decodedValue = mailMessage.Headers.GetDecodedValue("Thread-Topic");
		Console.WriteLine(decodedValue);

    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we perform the following steps:

1. We import necessary namespaces (`Aspose.Email` and `Aspose.Email.Mail`).
2. We create a `Main` method as the entry point of our application.
3. Within the `Main` method, we use the `MailMessage.Load` method to load an email message from a file. Replace `"path/to/your/email.eml"` with the actual path to the email message you want to process.
4. We use the `Headers.GetDecodedValue` method to decode the Subject header.
5. We print the decoded Subject header to the console.

## Step 5: Run the Application

Compile and run your application. Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/email.eml"` with the actual path to the email message you want to process. The application will load the email, extract the decoded Subject header, and display it in the console.
