## Implementation Guide
Now, let’s break down the steps to preserve email attachment boundaries using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Feature: Preserve Original Boundaries in Email Attachments

#### Overview
This feature ensures that when you save an email with attachments, the original MIME structure and boundaries are intact. This is particularly useful for legal or archival purposes where data integrity is critical.

#### Step 1: Load the Email Message
First, load your email message from a file or stream:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

// Define the path to your document directory.
string dataDir = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "email.eml");

MailMessage mailMessage = MailMessage.Load(dataDir);
```
**Explanation**: Here, we load an email message from a specified path. Ensure that `dataDir` points to your actual file location.

#### Step 2: Save with Preserved Boundaries
To save the email while preserving its original boundaries:

```csharp
string outputDir = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "savedEmail.eml");
mailMessage.Save(outputDir, Aspose.Email.SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```
**Explanation**: This step saves your loaded message to a new file. The `SaveOptions.DefaultEml` ensures the original MIME boundaries are preserved.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found Errors**: Double-check the file paths.
- **License Issues**: Ensure your license is correctly set if you're beyond the trial period.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for preserving email attachment boundaries:
1. **Legal Document Preservation**: Ensuring emails and attachments retain their original format for court proceedings.
2. **Archiving Systems**: Using in corporate archives where data integrity over time is crucial.
3. **Data Migration Projects**: Migrating emails between systems while maintaining fidelity.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize File I/O Operations**: Stream large files instead of loading them fully into memory.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects properly to free up resources using `using` statements or calling `.Dispose()`.

## Conclusion
You’ve now learned how to use Aspose.Email for .NET to preserve original boundaries in email attachments. This feature is vital for maintaining data integrity across various applications. Consider exploring further features of Aspose.Email for more advanced email handling capabilities.
