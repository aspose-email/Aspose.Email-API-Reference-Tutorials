# Automate Email Attachments with Aspose.Email for .NET
## How to Add Multiple Attachments to an Email Using Aspose.Email for .NET
### Introduction
Are you looking to automate the process of attaching files to emails within your application? This guide demonstrates how to use **Aspose.Email for .NET** to add multiple attachments seamlessly. With its powerful features, this library simplifies complex email management tasks.
In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How to set up Aspose.Email for .NET in your project
- Creating a `MailMessage` object
- Adding multiple attachments to an email
- Saving the email with its attachments

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are in place:

#### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **Aspose.Email for .NET**: Install this library via package managers.

#### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment supporting .NET (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework)
- Basic understanding of C# programming

#### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with file operations in C#
- Basic knowledge of email protocols and structures

### Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET
To use the Aspose.Email library, install it using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Package Manager Console (NuGet)**
```shell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
- Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.Email, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial version [here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/) to test its features.
- **Temporary License**: Get a temporary license for full access by visiting [this link](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a subscription at [Aspose's purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

After acquiring a license file, set it up as follows:
```csharp
Aspose.Email.License license = new Aspose.Email.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_license.lic");
```
With the setup complete, letâ€™s move on to adding attachments.

### Implementation Guide
#### Adding Attachments to Email
This feature enables you to append multiple files as attachments to a single email message, streamlining your workflow when sending bulk emails or documents.

##### Step 1: Set Up Directories and Create MailMessage
Firstly, establish the directories for reading attachment files and specify where to save the final email file. Then, initialize a `MailMessage` object with sender details:
```csharp
string dataDir = System.IO.Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "EmailAttachments");
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create an instance of MailMessage class
MailMessage message = new MailMessage { From = "sender@sender.com" };
message.To.Add("receiver@gmail.com");
```

##### Step 2: Load and Add Attachments
Load files from your specified directory and add them as attachments to the email:
```csharp
// Load and add attachments to the email
Attachment attachment1 = new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.txt");
message.Attachments.Add(attachment1);
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.jpg"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.doc"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.rar"));
message.AddAttachment(new Attachment(dataDir + "/1.pdf"));
```
Here, the `AddAttachment` method appends multiple files of various types (text, image, document) efficiently.

##### Step 3: Save the Email
Finally, save your email with all attachments to disk:
```csharp
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDir, "outputAttachments_out.msg");
message.Save(outputFile, SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Files**: Ensure all files exist in the specified directory.
- **Permission Issues**: Check if your application has necessary file access permissions.

### Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for this functionality:
1. **Automated Reports**: Automatically attach reports generated by an application to a summary email sent at regular intervals.
2. **Bulk Invoices**: Send invoices with multiple PDF attachments in a single email to clients.
3. **Document Sharing**: Share project-related documents, like contracts and images, with team members or stakeholders.

### Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when dealing with large emails:
- Monitor memory usage as `MailMessage` can consume significant resources with many attachments.
- Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements to free up memory after processing.
Following best practices for .NET memory management will ensure your application remains efficient and responsive.

### Conclusion
