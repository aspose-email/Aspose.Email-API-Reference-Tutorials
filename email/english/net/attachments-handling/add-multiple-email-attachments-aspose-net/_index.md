### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.
- Basic understanding of C# programming.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with email protocols and MIME types is beneficial but not mandatory.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

To get started, you need to install the Aspose.Email package. Here are a few methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize Aspose.Email in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that you're all set up, let’s move on to implementing the feature of adding multiple email attachments.

### Adding Multiple Attachments
**Overview**
This section explains how to add more than one attachment to an email using Aspose.Email for .NET. This is particularly useful when automating email tasks in business applications.

#### Step 1: Define Document Paths
Start by specifying paths to your documents:

```csharp
string dataDir = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
```
**Explanation:** Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the path where your files are stored. This ensures that your attachments can be accurately referenced during runtime.

#### Step 2: Create a MailMessage Object
Create an email message object to which you will add attachments:

```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@example.com";
message.To = "recipient@example.com";
message.Subject = "Documents Attached";
```
**Explanation:** Here, we're setting up the basic structure of our email with sender and recipient details.

#### Step 3: Add Attachments
Iterate over your files and attach them:

```csharp
string[] fileNames = { "file1.pdf", "file2.docx" }; // Example filenames

foreach (var fileName in fileNames)
{
    var attachment = new Attachment(Path.Combine(dataDir, fileName));
    message.Attachments.Add(attachment);
}
```
**Explanation:** This loop processes each filename in your list, creating an `Attachment` object for each and adding it to the email.

#### Step 4: Send the Email
Finally, configure your SMTP client and send the email:

```csharp
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "username", "password");
client.SecurityOptions = SecurityOptions.Auto;
client.Send(message);
```
**Explanation:** Configure the `SmtpClient` with your server details. Adjust the security settings as needed for your email provider.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found Errors:** Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- **SMTP Authentication Issues:** Double-check your SMTP credentials and server settings.
- **Attachment Size Limits:** Be aware of any size restrictions imposed by your email service provider.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where adding multiple attachments can be useful:
1. **Automated Reports**: Send periodic reports to clients or team members.
2. **Invoice Distribution**: Automatically attach invoices for billing purposes.
3. **Document Sharing**: Distribute policy documents or terms and conditions in one email.

## Performance Considerations
### Tips for Optimizing Performance
- Limit the number of attachments if possible to reduce load times.
- Use streaming APIs when handling large files to manage memory usage effectively.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Dispose of `Attachment` objects after use to free up resources promptly.
  
### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management with Aspose.Email
- Utilize using statements or explicit disposal patterns (`Dispose()`) to release unmanaged resources.

## Conclusion
You now know how to add multiple attachments to an email using Aspose.Email for .NET. This can significantly enhance your application's functionality, making it more robust and user-friendly.
