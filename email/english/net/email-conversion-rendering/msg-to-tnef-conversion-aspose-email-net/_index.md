## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through implementing MSG to TNEF conversion and handling different formats.

### Convert MSG to TNEF

#### Overview
Converting an Outlook MSG file to TNEF encapsulates all rich content, ensuring fidelity during transport across systems.

#### Steps for Conversion
**1. Load the MSG File:**
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;

string documentDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(documentDir + "/Message.msg");
```

**2. Set Conversion Options:**
```csharp
MailConversionOptions options = new MailConversionOptions { ConvertAsTnef = true };
```

**3. Convert and Process:**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

MailMessage mail = msg.ToMailMessage(options);
// Further processing or saving of 'mail' can occur here.
```

### Load and Save an Email File
#### Overview
Loading and saving emails in various formats is essential. This section demonstrates loading an email file and saving it as MSG.

**1. Load the Email Message:**
```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using System.IO;

string documentDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

MailMessage loadedEmail = MailMessage.Load(documentDir + "/SampleEmail.eml");
```

**2. Save in Another Format:**
```csharp
loadedEmail.Save(outputDir + "/ConvertedEmail.msg", SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
// The SaveOptions parameter specifies the output format.
```

## Practical Applications
Here are real-world use cases for converting emails and handling formats:
1. **Email Archiving:** Convert emails to TNEF to archive, preserving attachments and embedded content.
