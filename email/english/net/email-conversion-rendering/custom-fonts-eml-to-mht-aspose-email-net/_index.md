# Custom Fonts in EML to MHT Conversion with Aspose.Email

When converting emails from EML to MHT format, customizing fonts can enhance presentation and maintain branding consistency. This guide demonstrates how to apply custom font styles using Aspose.Email for .NET.

## What You'll Learn:
- How to convert EML files to MHT format with customized font styling.
- Setting up and initializing Aspose.Email in your .NET project.
- Step-by-step instructions on changing fonts during the conversion process.
- Practical applications and tips for optimizing performance.

Let's explore how you can enhance email file handling capabilities using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Email for .NET library**: Essential for working with email formats.
- **.NET development environment**: Such as Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and file manipulation in .NET.

#### Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET
To begin using Aspose.Email, add it to your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.Email, you can:
- Obtain a **free trial** to explore features.
- Get a **temporary license** for extended testing.
- Purchase a full license for production use.

Visit [Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or [Free Trial](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/) pages for more details. Initialize the library as follows:

```csharp
var license = new License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Email.lic");
```

### Implementation Guide
This section guides you through changing fonts during EML to MHT conversion.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directory Paths
Define paths for your input and output files:

```csharp
string dataDir = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Data");
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "input.eml");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "output.mht");
```

#### Step 2: Load the EML File
Load your EML file into a `MailMessage` object:

```csharp
var message = MailMessage.Load(inputFile);
```

Loading the email allows you to manipulate its content before conversion.

#### Step 3: Customize Font Style
Customize the HTML body of the email by changing font styles:

```csharp
message.HtmlBody = message.HtmlBody.Replace("font-family", "font-family: 'Your Custom Font', sans-serif;");
```

This code snippet replaces instances of `font-family` with your desired style.

#### Step 4: Convert to MHT
Save the modified email as an MHT file:

```csharp
var mhtSaveOptions = new MhtmlSaveOptions();
message.Save(outputFile, mhtSaveOptions);
```

The `MhtmlSaveOptions` class allows for additional configurations if needed.

### Practical Applications
1. **Email Branding**: Customize emails to match your brand's visual identity.
2. **Legal Documentation**: Ensure consistent font usage in legal communications stored as MHT files.
3. **Marketing Campaigns**: Enhance readability and appeal of promotional content.

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Compress images within emails before conversion to limit file size.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `MailMessage` objects properly to free resources.
