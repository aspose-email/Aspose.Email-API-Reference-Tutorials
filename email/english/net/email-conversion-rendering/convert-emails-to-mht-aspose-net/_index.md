```

```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the process into two main features: saving emails with optional settings and excluding inline images.

### Save MHTML with Optional Settings

This feature allows you to save email messages as MHT files while specifying formatting options.

#### Overview

You can customize how your email is saved by including header information, validating content encoding, and displaying original headers.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up File Paths**
   
   Define the directory paths for reading input emails and saving output MHT files.
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Email");
   ```

2. **Load the Email Message**

   Use `MailMessage.Load` to read an email from a file.
   ```csharp
   MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(Path.Combine(dataDir, "Message.eml"));
   ```

3. **Configure MHT Save Options**

   Set up `MhtSaveOptions` with desired formatting options.
   ```csharp
   MhtSaveOptions mhtSaveOptions = new MhtSaveOptions
   {
       MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader | MhtFormatOptions.HideExtraPrintHeader | MhtFormatOptions.DisplayAsOutlook,
       CheckBodyContentEncoding = true
   };
   ```

4. **Save the Email as an MHT File**

   Use the `Save` method to write the email content with specified options.
   ```csharp
   eml.Save(Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "outMessage_out.mht"), mhtSaveOptions);
   ```

### Convert to MHTML Without Inline Images

This feature demonstrates saving an email as an MHT file while skipping inline images.

#### Overview

By setting `SkipInlineImages` to true, you can save email content without embedding any images directly in the file.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up File Paths**
   
   As before, define your input and output directories.
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Email");
   ```

2. **Load the Email Message**

   Load the email you want to convert.
   ```csharp
   MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(Path.Combine(dataDir, "Message.eml"));
   ```

3. **Configure MHT Save Options**

   Set `SkipInlineImages` to true in your options configuration.
   ```csharp
   MhtSaveOptions mhtSaveOptions = new MhtSaveOptions
   {
       SkipInlineImages = true
   };
   ```

4. **Save the Email as an MHT File**

   Finally, save the email without inline images.
   ```csharp
   eml.Save(Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "EmlToMhtmlWithoutInlineImages_out.mht"), mhtSaveOptions);
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Double-check that Aspose.Email is properly licensed if you encounter feature limitations.

## Practical Applications

These features can be utilized in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Archiving Emails**: Preserve email conversations in a static format for long-term storage.
2. **Email Content Analysis**: Extract and analyze email content without images for faster processing.
3. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Automate the conversion of emails into document formats compatible with your existing systems.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance:

- Minimize memory usage by disposing objects properly after use.
- Use Aspose.Email’s efficient handling methods to manage large email datasets.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to convert emails to MHT files using Aspose.Email for .NET, both with optional settings and without inline images. This flexibility allows you to tailor the output to fit your specific needs.

Next steps include experimenting with other features provided by Aspose.Email or integrating this functionality into larger projects.
