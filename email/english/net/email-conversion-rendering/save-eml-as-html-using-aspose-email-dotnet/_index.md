## Implementation Guide

### Saving EML Files as Basic HTML

**Overview:**
Convert a simple EML file to an HTML format with default settings. Ideal for quick conversions without additional customization.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Load the EML File:**
   Load your email message from a specified directory using `MailMessage.Load`.
   
    ```csharp
    string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
    MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "/Message.eml");
    ```
2. **Save as HTML:**
   Use default HTML save options to convert and save your email.

    ```csharp
    message.Save(dataDir + "/SaveAsHTML_out.html", SaveOptions.DefaultHtml);
    ```

### Saving EML Files with Custom HTML Options

**Overview:**
Explore saving EML files as HTML while applying specific formatting preferences. Useful for including headers and full email addresses without embedding resources.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Load the EML File:**
   Similar to basic conversion but with custom options initialized.
   
    ```csharp
    MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "/Message.eml");
    ```
2. **Initialize HTML Save Options:**
   Customize your HTML output by specifying particular format options.
   
    ```csharp
    HtmlSaveOptions options = SaveOptions.DefaultHtml;
    options.EmbedResources = false;
    options.HtmlFormatOptions = HtmlFormatOptions.WriteHeader | HtmlFormatOptions.WriteCompleteEmailAddress;
    ```
3. **Save the Message with Custom Options:**
   Convert and save your email using these customized settings.

    ```csharp
    eml.Save(dataDir + "/SaveAsHTML1_out.html", options);
    ```

### Saving EML Files without Embedding Resources

**Overview:**
Focus on saving EML files as HTML while handling resources separately. Ideal when managing attachments independently from your email content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Define File Paths:**
   Set up paths for loading the message and outputting the HTML file.
    
    ```csharp
    var fileName = "EmailWithAttandEmbedded.eml";
    var filePath = Path.Combine(dataDir, fileName);
    var outFileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, fileName + ".html");
    ```
2. **Load the Mail Message:**
   Load your email message with attachments from a specified path.
    
    ```csharp
    MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(filePath);
    ```
3. **Initialize Save Options Without Embedding Resources:**

    Define custom handling for resources, such as saving attachments separately.
    
    ```csharp
    var options = new HtmlSaveOptions()
    {
        EmbedResources = false,
        SaveResourceHandler =
            (AttachmentBase attachment, out string resourcePath) =>
            {
                attachment.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, attachment.ContentId));
                resourcePath = Path.Combine(".", attachment.ContentId);
            }
    };
    ```
4. **Convert and Save the Email:**
   Use these options to save your email as an HTML file without embedded resources.

    ```csharp
    msg.Save(outFileName, options);
    ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the `dataDir` path is correctly set and accessible.
- Check for any missing dependencies in your project setup.
- Validate that all required permissions are available for reading and writing files.

## Practical Applications

Here are some scenarios where converting EML to HTML can be beneficial:

1. **Email Archiving**: Save archived emails in web-friendly formats for easier access and readability.
2. **Customer Support Systems**: Convert customer communications into a format that’s easy to share with support teams or integrate into ticketing systems.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Enhance CMS capabilities by allowing email content to be displayed as part of web pages.
4. **Data Migration Projects**: Use HTML conversion as part of migrating data from legacy email systems to modern platforms.
5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Generate reports or documentation that include formatted email conversations.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize File Handling**: Ensure efficient file I/O operations by managing memory usage effectively when dealing with large numbers of emails.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement asynchronous processing for handling multiple conversions to improve application responsiveness.
- **Resource Management**: Carefully manage resources, especially attachments, to avoid unnecessary duplication and save space.
