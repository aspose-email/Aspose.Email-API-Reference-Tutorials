# Constructing a New Mail Message in C#


Are you looking to enhance your C# application by adding the capability to send emails programmatically? With the power of Aspose.Email for .NET, you can seamlessly integrate email functionalities into your application. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of constructing a new mail message using Aspose.Email for .NET, complete with source code examples.

## 1. Introduction to Aspose.Email for .NET

Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to work with emails in your C# applications. It provides a wide range of features, including creating, sending, receiving, and manipulating emails. In this tutorial, we'll focus on constructing a new mail message from scratch.

## 2. Setting Up Your Project

Before you begin, make sure you have a C# development environment set up on your machine. You can use Visual Studio or any other C# IDE of your choice.

## 3. Adding Aspose.Email to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Aspose.Email library to your project. You can do this by using NuGet Package Manager. Open the NuGet Package Manager and search for "Aspose.Email" to install the required package.

## 4. Creating a New Mail Message

Let's start by creating a new instance of the `MailMessage` class provided by Aspose.Email. This class represents an email message.

```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

## 5. Specifying Email Recipients

Next, you'll need to specify the recipients of the email. Use the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` properties of the `MailMessage` class to add email addresses.

```csharp
message.To.Add("recipient@example.com");
message.Cc.Add("cc@example.com");
message.Bcc.Add("bcc@example.com");
```

## 6. Setting the Email Subject and Body

Set the subject and body of the email using the `Subject` and `HtmlBody` properties.

```csharp
message.Subject = "Hello from Aspose.Email!";
message.HtmlBody = "<p>This is the <b>HTML</b> body of the email.</p>";
```

## 7. Adding Attachments

You can attach files to the email using the `Attachments` property.

```csharp
Attachment attachment = new Attachment("path/to/attachment.pdf");
message.Attachments.Add(attachment);
```

## 8. Adding Hyperlinks

To add hyperlinks within the email body, use the HTML `<a>` tag.

```csharp
message.HtmlBody += "<p>Click <a href='https://example.com'>here</a> to visit our website.</p>";
```

## 9. Formatting the Email

Aspose.Email allows you to format the email content using HTML and CSS.

```csharp
message.HtmlBody += "<p style='color: blue;'>This text is blue.</p>";
```

## 10. Sending the Email

Once you've constructed the email message, it's time to send it using the `SmtpClient` class.

```csharp
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "your_username", "your_password");
client.Send(message);
```

## 11. Error Handling

When sending emails, it's important to handle errors gracefully. Use try-catch blocks to capture any exceptions that may occur during the sending process.

```csharp
try
{
    client.Send(message);
    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

## 12. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to construct a new mail message using Aspose.Email for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the process of adding email functionality to your C# applications.
