# Specifying Recipient Addresses in C#



This guide will walk you through the process of specifying recipient addresses in C# using the Aspose.Email for .NET library. Aspose.Email is a powerful .NET API that allows you to work with email messages and various email-related tasks. In this tutorial, we will cover how to add recipient addresses to an email message using the library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio or any C# development environment installed.
2. Aspose.Email for .NET library. You can get it from the [Aspose.Email for .NET Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).

## Steps

Follow these steps to specify recipient addresses in C# using Aspose.Email for .NET:

### 1. Create a new C# project

Start by creating a new C# project in your development environment.

### 2. Add reference to Aspose.Email

1. Download and install the Aspose.Email for .NET library if you haven't already.
2. Open your C# project.
3. Right-click on the "References" in the Solution Explorer and select "Add Reference."
4. Browse and select the Aspose.Email DLL files that you downloaded.

### 3. Import necessary namespaces

In your C# code file, import the necessary namespaces for using Aspose.Email classes:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

```

### 4. Create and configure the email message

Create a new instance of the `MailMessage` class to represent your email message. Configure the sender and subject of the email:

```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = new MailAddress("sender@example.com");
message.Subject = "Hello from Aspose.Email";
```

### 5. Add recipient addresses

You can add recipient addresses using the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` properties of the `MailMessage` class. Here's how you can add recipient addresses:

```csharp
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("recipient1@example.com"));
message.Cc.Add(new MailAddress("recipient2@example.com"));
message.Bcc.Add(new MailAddress("recipient3@example.com"));
```

### 6. Complete the email message

Add the email body and any other necessary content to your email message:

```csharp
message.Body = "This is the email body.";
```

### 7. Send the email

To send the email, you can use the `SmtpClient` class provided by Aspose.Email. Configure the SMTP server settings and send the email:

```csharp
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "your_username", "your_password");
client.SecurityOptions = SecurityOptions.Auto;

client.Send(message);
```

## FAQs

### How can I add multiple recipients to the `To`, `Cc`, or `Bcc` fields?

You can add multiple recipients by calling the `Add` method multiple times on the respective `MailAddressCollection`:

```csharp
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("recipient1@example.com"));
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("recipient2@example.com"));
```

### Can I specify recipient names along with their email addresses?

Yes, you can specify both the recipient's name and email address when adding recipients:

```csharp
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("recipient@example.com", "Recipient Name"));
```

### How do I handle exceptions when sending an email?

You can use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions that might occur during email sending:

```csharp
try
{
    client.Send(message);
    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```
