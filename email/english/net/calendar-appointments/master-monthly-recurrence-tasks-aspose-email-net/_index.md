```

## Implementation Guide

### Monthly Recurrence Task Setup with End After N Occurrences

Learn how to create tasks that recur monthly and stop after a specific number of occurrences.

#### Overview:
We'll use `MapiTask` from Aspose.Email.Mapi, configure it for monthly recurrence, and set an end condition.

##### Step 1: Define Task Dates
Set the start date, due date, and end-by date using your local timezone to align with user expectations.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;
using Aspose.Email.Calendar.Recurrences;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
TimeZone localZone = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone;
TimeSpan ts = localZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now);
DateTime StartDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(ts);
DateTime DueDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(ts);
DateTime endByDate = new DateTime(2015, 12, 31).Add(ts);
```

##### Step 2: Create and Configure the Task
Initialize a `MapiTask` instance with your task description and dates.

```csharp
// Create a MapiTask with start and due dates.
MapiTask task = new MapiTask("This is a test task", "Test Description", StartDate, DueDate);
```

##### Step 3: Set Monthly Recurrence Pattern
Configure the recurrence pattern to repeat monthly and specify the number of occurrences.

```csharp
// Create a monthly recurrence rule ending after 10 occurrences.
MapiCalendarEventRecurrence recurrence = new MapiCalendarEventRecurrence();
recurrence.Pattern = new MonthlyPattern(1); // Recur every month
recurrence.EndType = MapiCalendarEventRecurrenceEndType.NoEndDate;
recurrence.Range = new OccurrenceRange(StartDate, endByDate, 10);

// Assign the recurrence rule to the task.
task.Recurrence = recurrence;
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure all date and time calculations account for local timezone differences.
- Verify Aspose.Email installation by checking the package version in your project.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be used in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Project Management Tools**: Automate recurring project check-ins or reviews.
2. **Billing Systems**: Schedule monthly invoice generation and reminders.
3. **Subscription Services**: Manage renewal notifications for subscription-based services.

Integration with CRM software or email clients can enhance user engagement by automating task flows.

## Performance Considerations

When using Aspose.Email in .NET applications, consider:
- Monitoring memory usage when handling large volumes of tasks to prevent leaks.
- Optimizing performance by batching operations where possible.
- Following best practices for efficient .NET memory management to ensure smooth application performance.

## Conclusion

This tutorial guided you through setting up monthly recurrence tasks using Aspose.Email.Mapi in a .NET environment. By following these steps, you can automate and manage tasks efficiently in your applications. Explore more complex scheduling scenarios or integrate additional features for advanced capabilities.

## FAQ Section

**Q1: How do I modify the recurrence pattern to weekly instead of monthly?**
A1: Change `MonthlyPattern(1)` to `WeeklyPattern(1)` and configure accordingly.

**Q2: Can I set a different number of occurrences for each task?**
A2: Yes, adjust the `OccurrenceRange` in your recurrence configuration.

**Q3: What if my tasks need to handle different time zones?**
A3: Always calculate dates using the local timezone offset as shown in Step 1.

**Q4: How do I install Aspose.Email for .NET on Linux?**
A4: Use the .NET CLI or NuGet package manager within your preferred development environment on Linux.

**Q5: Is there a way to debug issues with recurrence tasks?**
A5: Check logs and ensure date calculations are accurate. Utilize breakpoints to trace through task setup code if needed.
