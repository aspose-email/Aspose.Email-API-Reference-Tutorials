# Create Weekly Recurring Tasks Using Aspose.Email .NET for Calendar & Appointments

## Introduction

Managing recurring tasks can be challenging, especially when they need to repeat weekly and integrate seamlessly into your workflow. This tutorial guides you through creating weekly recurring tasks using the powerful Aspose.Email for .NET library, ideal for automating reminders or scheduling regular updates.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to create a MapiTask with weekly recurrence.
- Setting up and configuring Aspose.Email for .NET.
- Calculating task occurrences between dates using recurrence rules.
- Real-world applications of integrating recurring tasks into business processes.

Let's streamline your task management process!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Aspose.Email for .NET** installed. Installation instructions are provided below.
- A compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) for C# development.
- Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with date manipulations.

### Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

To begin, install the Aspose.Email library in your project:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "Aspose.Email" and select the latest version to install.

#### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Download a free trial from [Aspose Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license at [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a license through [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once you have the package installed and your license set up, initialize Aspose.Email as follows:
```csharp
// Basic initialization example (not mandatory in all contexts)
var license = new Aspose.Email.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_your_license_file.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

This section covers two main features: creating a weekly recurring task and calculating occurrences.

### Feature 1: Weekly Task Creation with Recurrence

**Overview:**
Learn how to create a MapiTask that repeats weekly using Aspose.Email's `MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern`, automating task creation without manual intervention for each occurrence.

#### Step 1: Define Dates and Adjust for Time Zone
```csharp
// Define the start, due, and end dates for the task
DateTime StartDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime DueDate = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime EndByDate = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1);

// Adjust dates based on local time zone offset
timeZone localZone = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone;
TimeSpan ts = localZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now);
StartDate = StartDate.Add(ts);
DueDate = DueDate.Add(ts);
EndByDate = EndByDate.Add(ts);
```
**Explanation:**
The task's start, due, and end dates are adjusted for the current time zone offset to ensure accuracy across different regions.

#### Step 2: Create and Configure MapiTask
```csharp
// Create a new MapiTask with specified details
MapiTask task = new MapiTask("This is a test task", "Sample Body", StartDate, DueDate);
task.State = MapiTaskState.NotAssigned;
```
**Explanation:**
Initialize the `MapiTask` object with a title, body, start date, and due date. Set the task state to `NotAssigned`, marking it as pending.

#### Step 3: Set Weekly Recurrence Pattern
```csharp
// Configure the weekly recurrence pattern for the task
var rec = new MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern
{
    EndType = MapiCalendarRecurrenceEndType.EndAfterNOccurrences,
    PatternType = MapiCalendarRecurrencePatternType.Week,
    Period = 1,
    WeekStartDay = DayOfWeek.Sunday,
    DayOfWeek = MapiCalendarDayOfWeek.Friday,
    OccurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(StartDate, EndByDate, "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR"),
};

// Ensure there is at least one occurrence
if (rec.OccurrenceCount == 0)
{
    rec.OccurrenceCount = 1;
}
task.Recurrence = rec;
```
**Explanation:**
This snippet configures the task to recur weekly on Fridays. The `GetOccurrenceCount` function calculates how many occurrences fall between the start and end dates.

#### Step 4: Save Task
```csharp
// Save the task to a file in the specified output directory
string outputPath = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Weekly_out.msg";
task.Save(outputPath, TaskSaveFormat.Msg);
```
**Explanation:**
The completed task is saved as an MSG file. Ensure you replace `@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your actual path.

### Feature 2: Calculating Occurrences Between Two Dates with Recurrence Rule

**Overview:**
Determine the number of times a recurring event occurs between two dates using Aspose.Email's `CalendarRecurrence` class.

#### Step 1: Define Dates and Recurrence Rule
```csharp
// Set start and end dates to calculate occurrences
DateTime Start = new DateTime(2015, 7, 16);
DateTime EndBy = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1);
string RRule = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR";
```
**Explanation:**
These variables set up the date range and define a rule for weekly occurrences on Fridays.

#### Step 2: Calculate Occurrences
```csharp
// Get the count of occurrences between the two dates based on the recurrence rule
uint occurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(Start, EndBy, RRule);
```
**Explanation:**
The function calculates how many times the task recurs within the specified period.

#### Step 3: Implement `GetOccurrenceCount` Method
```csharp
private static uint GetOccurrenceCount(DateTime start, DateTime endBy, string rrule)
{
    // Create a CalendarRecurrence object with DTSTART and RRULE format
    CalendarRecurrence pattern = new CalendarRecurrence(string.Format("DTSTART:{0}\r\nRRULE:{1}", start.ToString("yyyyMMdd"), rrule));

    // Generate occurrences within the specified date range
    DateCollection dates = pattern.GenerateOccurrences(start, endBy);

    // Return the count of generated occurrences
    return (uint)dates.Count;
}
```
**Explanation:**
The `CalendarRecurrence` object is initialized with a start date and recurrence rule, generating occurrences that fall within the given range.

## Practical Applications

Explore real-world scenarios where weekly recurring tasks can be integrated:
1. **Project Management:** Automate regular status update reminders for team members on a set schedule.
2. **Finance:** Schedule weekly financial report generation and distribution to stakeholders.
3. **Customer Support:** Set up weekly follow-up calls or emails to key clients for service feedback.
4. **HR Administration:** Implement recurring performance review schedules for employees.
5. **Healthcare:** Automate the scheduling of routine patient check-ups or medication reminders.
