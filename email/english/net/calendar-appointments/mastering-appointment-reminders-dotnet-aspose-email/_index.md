## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to implement different types of reminders using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Adding Audio Reminder to Appointment
**Overview**

Audio reminders help ensure you never miss an appointment by providing audible alerts at specified times.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Appointment
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Calendar;

Appointment target = new Appointment(location, startDate, endDate, organizer, attendees);
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Audio Reminder
```csharp
// Creating an audio reminder.
AppointmentReminder audioReminder = new AppointmentReminder();
audioReminder.Trigger = new ReminderTrigger(new DateTime(1997, 3, 17, 13, 30, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc));
audioReminder.Repeat = 4;
audioReminder.Duration = new ReminderDuration(new TimeSpan(0, 15, 0));
audioReminder.Action = ReminderAction.Audio;

// Attaching an audio file.
ReminderAttachment attach = new ReminderAttachment(new Uri("ftp://Host.com/pub/sounds/bell-01.aud"));
audioReminder.Attachments.Add(attach);
target.Reminders.Add(audioReminder);
```
**Explanation**: This snippet sets up a reminder that plays an audio clip at UTC 13:30, repeating four more times with each lasting 15 minutes.

### Adding Display Reminder to Appointment
**Overview**

Display reminders provide visual cues on your device before an appointment begins.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Appointment
```csharp
Appointment target = new Appointment(location, startDate, endDate, organizer, attendees);
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Display Reminder
```csharp
// Creating a display reminder.
AppointmentReminder displayReminder = new AppointmentReminder();
ReminderDuration dur = new ReminderDuration(new TimeSpan(0, -30, 0));
displayReminder.Trigger = new ReminderTrigger(dur, ReminderRelated.Start);
displayReminder.Repeat = 2;
displayReminder.Duration = new ReminderDuration(new TimeSpan(0, 15, 0));
displayReminder.Action = ReminderAction.Display;

// Setting description.
displayReminder.Description = "Breakfast meeting with executive team at 8:30 AM EST";
target.Reminders.Add(displayReminder);
```
**Explanation**: This code triggers a display reminder 30 minutes before the event starts, repeating twice.

### Adding Email Reminder to Appointment
**Overview**

Email reminders ensure that all attendees receive notifications and necessary materials ahead of time.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Appointment
```csharp
Appointment target = new Appointment(location, startDate, endDate, organizer, attendees);
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Email Reminder
```csharp
// Creating an email reminder.
AppointmentReminder emailReminder = new AppointmentReminder();
ReminderDuration dur1 = new ReminderDuration(new TimeSpan(-2, 0, 0, 0));
emailReminder.Trigger = new ReminderTrigger(dur1, ReminderRelated.Start);
ReminderAttendee attendee = new ReminderAttendee("john_doe@host.com");
emailReminder.Attendees.Add(attendee);
emailReminder.Action = ReminderAction.Email;
emailReminder.Summary = "REMINDER: SEND AGENDA FOR WEEKLY STAFF MEETING";
emailReminder.Description = "A draft agenda needs to be sent out.";

// Attaching a document.
ReminderAttachment attach1 = new ReminderAttachment(new Uri("http://Host.com/templates/agenda.doc"));
emailReminder.Attachments.Add(attach1);
target.Reminders.Add(emailReminder);
```
**Explanation**: This reminder sends an email two days prior, including an agenda attachment.

### Adding Procedural Alarm to Appointment
**Overview**

Procedural alarms can trigger specific actions or scripts at predefined times.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Appointment
```csharp
Appointment target = new Appointment(location, startDate, endDate, organizer, attendees);
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Procedural Reminder
```csharp
// Creating a procedural reminder.
AppointmentReminder procReminder = new AppointmentReminder();
procReminder.Trigger = new ReminderTrigger(new DateTime(1998, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc));
procReminder.Repeat = 23;
procReminder.Duration = new ReminderDuration(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0));
procReminder.Action = ReminderAction.Procedure;

// Attaching a procedure file.
ReminderAttachment attach2 = new ReminderAttachment(new Uri("ftp://Host.com/novo-procs/felizano.exe"));
procReminder.Attachments.Add(attach2);
target.Reminders.Add(procReminder);

// Save the appointment.
target.Save(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\savedFile_out.ics");
```
**Explanation**: This reminder triggers a procedure at 5:00 AM UTC and repeats 23 times.
