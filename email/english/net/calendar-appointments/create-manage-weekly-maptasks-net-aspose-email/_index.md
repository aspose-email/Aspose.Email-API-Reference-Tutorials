# How to Create Weekly Recurring MapiTasks in .NET Using Aspose.Email

## Introduction

Efficiently managing recurring tasks is crucial for developers working on applications that involve scheduling or calendar functionalities. Whether you're developing an internal tool for task management or integrating calendar features into a business application, creating and managing weekly recurring tasks can significantly enhance productivity.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use **Aspose.Email for .NET** to create weekly recurring MapiTasks ending after a specific date. This feature is invaluable for developers looking to automate scheduling within their applications using Aspose.Email's robust functionalities.

### What You'll Learn:
- Setting up and configuring Aspose.Email for .NET
- Creating a weekly recurring MapiTask with a specified end date
- Implementing multiple-day recurrence patterns
- Calculating occurrence counts based on custom recurrence rules

Ready to dive into creating powerful scheduling solutions? Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Aspose.Email for .NET** library: You can install it using NuGet or other package managers.
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1 or later** or **.NET Core/5+**: Ensure your development environment is set up with a compatible .NET version.
- Basic knowledge of C# and familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

To start using Aspose.Email for .NET, you need to add it to your project. Here's how:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

You can acquire a license through:

- **Free Trial**: Test features without limitations.
- **Temporary License**: Use this to evaluate extended capabilities.
- **Purchase**: For full access, purchase a commercial license.

Once you have your license file, initialize Aspose.Email by applying the license in your code:
```csharp
Aspose.Email.License license = new Aspose.Email.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_license_file.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into two main features: creating a single-day weekly recurrence and setting up multiple-day recurrences.

### Creating a Weekly Recurring MapiTask Ending After a Specific Date

#### Overview
This feature allows you to create tasks that recur on a specific day each week until they end after a given date. It's perfect for scheduling recurring meetings or deadlines.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Configure the Recurrence Pattern**
Here, we'll set up the recurrence pattern using `MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern`.
```csharp
var rec = new MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern
{
    EndType = MapiCalendarRecurrenceEndType.EndAfterDate,
    PatternType = MapiCalendarRecurrencePatternType.Week,
    Period = 1, // Weekly recurrence
    WeekStartDay = DayOfWeek.Sunday,
    DayOfWeek = MapiCalendarDayOfWeek.Friday, // Recur on Fridays
    EndDate = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)),
    OccurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(
        new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)),
        new DateTime(2015, 9, 1).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)), 
        "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR;INTERVAL=1")
};
```
**Step 2: Create the MapiTask**
Now that we have our recurrence pattern configured, let's create a task and assign this pattern to it.
```csharp
MapiTask task = new MapiTask(
    "This is test task",
    "Sample Body",
    new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)),
    new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now))
);
task.State = MapiTaskState.NotAssigned;

if (rec.OccurrenceCount == 0)
{
    rec.OccurrenceCount = 1; // Ensure at least one occurrence
}

task.Recurrence = rec;
```
**Step 3: Save the Task**
Finally, save your task to a .msg file for persistence.
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
task.Save(dataDir + "/SetWeeklyEndAfterDateEveryDayRecurrence_out.msg", TaskSaveFormat.Msg);
```

### Creating a Weekly Recurring MapiTask on Multiple Days Ending After a Specific Date

#### Overview
This feature extends the previous setup to allow tasks that recur on multiple days each week, providing flexibility for more complex scheduling needs.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Configure the Multi-Day Recurrence Pattern**
Set up a pattern that includes multiple recurrence days per week.
```csharp
var record = new MapiCalendarWeeklyRecurrencePattern
{
    EndType = MapiCalendarRecurrenceEndType.EndAfterDate,
    PatternType = MapiCalendarRecurrencePatternType.Week,
    Period = 2, // Occurs every two weeks
    WeekStartDay = DayOfWeek.Sunday,
    EndDate = new DateTime(2015, 9, 1).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)),
    DayOfWeek = MapiCalendarDayOfWeek.Friday | MapiCalendarDayOfWeek.Monday, // Recur on Fridays and Mondays
    OccurrenceCount = GetOccurrenceCount(
        new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)), 
        new DateTime(2015, 9, 1).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)), 
        "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR,MO;INTERVAL=2")
};
```
**Step 2: Create and Assign the MapiTask**
Similar to before, create a task and assign this multi-day pattern.
```csharp
MapiTask task = new MapiTask(
    "This is test task",
    "Sample Body",
    new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now)),
    new DateTime(2015, 7, 16).Add(TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now))
);
task.State = MapiTaskState.NotAssigned;
task.Recurrence = record;
```
**Step 3: Save the Multi-Day Task**
Save your task similarly to ensure it is stored correctly.
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
task.Save(dataDir + "/SetWeeklyEndAfterDateMultipleDaysRecurrence_out.msg", TaskSaveFormat.Msg);
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some practical applications of these features:

1. **Automating Weekly Meetings**: Schedule recurring team meetings on specific days, like Fridays.
2. **Task Deadlines**: Set up weekly deadlines for project tasks that recur every Monday and Friday.
3. **Event Planning**: Manage event planning schedules that require follow-ups on multiple days each week.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Ensure you dispose of objects properly to avoid memory leaks, especially when dealing with large datasets or numerous recurring tasks.
- **Efficient Date Calculations**: Use efficient algorithms for date calculations within your recurrence rules to minimize processing time.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: When saving tasks to disk or network locations, consider asynchronous methods to enhance performance.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to create and manage weekly recurring MapiTasks using Aspose.Email for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily implement sophisticated scheduling features in your applications.

To further explore Aspose.Email's capabilities or tackle more complex scenarios, consider reviewing their official documentation and community forums.
