- Retrieve and display email subjects

Let's begin by reviewing the prerequisites before we start coding.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have:
- **Aspose.Email for .NET**: Ensure that you have the latest version installed in your development environment.
- **Development Environment**: A setup where .NET projects can be created and executed. Visual Studio or any compatible IDE is recommended.
- **Basic Knowledge of C#**: Familiarity with C# syntax and .NET framework will help you grasp the concepts more quickly.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

Before we start implementing features, let's set up Aspose.Email in your project.

### Installation

You can add Aspose.Email to your .NET project using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**

```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Package Manager Console**

```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use Aspose.Email, you need to acquire a license. Here's how:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial by downloading from [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
- **Temporary License**: If you need more time, request a temporary license at [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a license via the [Aspose Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

Once installed and licensed, initialize Aspose.Email in your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Apply Metered License
Aspose.Email.License license = new Aspose.Email.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you're set up, let's delve into the implementation of key features using Aspose.Email.

### Feature: Apply Metered License

The metered licensing feature is crucial for controlling and managing your API usage efficiently.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Metered Key

To apply a metered license, use the `SetMeteredKey` method by passing in your public and private keys. This helps you manage API calls effectively.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Access the SetMeteredKey property and pass your keys.
Aspose.Email.Metered metered = new Aspose.Email.Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
```

**Parameters**: Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with actual values from your Aspose account.

### Feature: Load Email Document

Loading an email document is straightforward, allowing you to process emails stored on disk.

#### Step 2: Define the Path and Load the Document

Start by specifying the directory where your email files are located. Then use `MailMessage.Load` to read the email file.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Define the path to your document directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Load the email document from disk.
MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "Message.eml");
```

**Parameters**: Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual path where your emails are stored.

### Feature: Retrieve Email Subject

After loading an email, you might want to access specific information like its subject line.

#### Step 3: Access and Display Email Subject

Retrieve the subject of the loaded email using the `Subject` property.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;

// Retrieve the subject of the loaded email message.
string subject = eml.Subject;
Console.WriteLine("Email Subject: " + subject);
```

## Practical Applications

Understanding these features is just the beginning. Here are some practical applications:
- **Automated Email Processing**: Use this setup to automate processing and analyzing emails for business insights.
- **Data Migration Tools**: Load and transform email data during migration from one system to another.
- **Customer Support Systems**: Retrieve and analyze customer inquiries efficiently.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using Aspose.Email in .NET:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage, especially if processing large volumes of emails.
- **Best Practices for Memory Management**: Dispose of `MailMessage` objects properly to free resources.
