## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into specific features using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Feature 1: Connect to IMAP Server

**Overview:** This feature demonstrates establishing a connection with an IMAP server, checking if UIDPLUS is supported by the server.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Initialize ImapClient
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Imap;

public class FeatureConnectToIMAPServer
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        using (ImapClient client = new ImapClient("exchange.aspose.com", "username", "password"))
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine(client.UidPlusSupported.ToString());
            }
            finally
            {
                // Cleanup resources if needed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Parameters**: Replace `"exchange.aspose.com"`, `"username"`, and `"password"` with your IMAP server details.
- **Return Values**: `client.UidPlusSupported` checks for UIDPLUS support, crucial for advanced message operations.

### Feature 2: Append Message to IMAP Inbox

**Overview:** This feature shows how to append a new email message to an inbox folder on an IMAP server.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Select Inbox and Create Message
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Imap;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

public class FeatureAppendMessageToIMAPIBox
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        using (ImapClient client = new ImapClient("exchange.aspose.com", "username", "password"))
        {
            try
            {
                client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
                
                MailMessage message = new MailMessage(
                    "from@Aspose.com",
                    "to@Aspose.com",
                    "EMAILNET-35227 - " + Guid.NewGuid(),
                    "EMAILNET-35227 Add ability in ImapClient to delete message"
                );

                string emailId = client.AppendMessage(message);
            }
            finally
            {
                // Cleanup resources if needed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Configuration Options**: Customize the `MailMessage` parameters for sender, recipient, subject, and body.
- **Key Method**: `AppendMessage()` adds your message to the inbox.

### Feature 3: List Messages in IMAP Inbox

**Overview:** This feature lists all messages in an IMAP server's inbox folder, providing a count of emails present.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### List and Output Message Count
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Imap;

public class FeatureListMessagesInIMAPIBox
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        using (ImapClient client = new ImapClient("exchange.aspose.com", "username", "password"))
        {
            try
            {
                client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
                
                ImapMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol = client.ListMessages();
                Console.WriteLine(messageInfoCol.Count);
            }
            finally
            {
                // Cleanup resources if needed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Return Values**: `ListMessages()` returns a collection of messages, with `Count` providing the total number.

### Feature 4: Delete a Single Message from IMAP Inbox

**Overview:** This feature demonstrates deleting a specific email message by its unique ID from an IMAP server's inbox folder.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Select Folder and Delete Specific Email
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Imap;

public class FeatureDeleteSingleMessageFromIMAPIBox
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        using (ImapClient client = new ImapClient("exchange.aspose.com", "username", "password"))
        {
            try
            {
                client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
                
                string emailId = "unique-email-id-here"; // Replace with actual ID
                client.DeleteMessage(emailId);
                
                client.CommitDeletes();
            }
            finally
            {
                // Cleanup resources if needed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Parameters**: Ensure `emailId` matches the specific message you wish to delete.
- **Key Method**: `CommitDeletes()` finalizes the deletion process on the server.

## Practical Applications
