# How to Create and Send Messages with Voting Options Using Aspose.Email for .NET

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on leveraging the Aspose.Email for .NET library to create and send emails with voting options. In today's dynamic business environment, effectively gathering feedback is crucial. Whether conducting a survey or seeking team approval, integrating voting buttons into your emails can streamline decision-making processes.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement this feature using Aspose.Email for .NET, an efficient library designed to handle various email operations in .NET applications. By the end of this guide, you’ll know:
- How to set up and configure Aspose.Email for .NET.
- The steps to create a basic email message.
- Techniques to add voting options to your emails.
- Practical use cases where these features are beneficial.

Let's dive into what you need to get started!

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Aspose.Email for .NET Library:** You'll need version 22.10 or later. This library can be easily installed via different package managers.
- **Development Environment:** A working setup with either Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE that supports .NET development.
- **Basic Knowledge of C#:** Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow the code examples more effectively.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET
To start using Aspose.Email for .NET, you first need to install it. Here’s how you can do so:

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

### Package Manager Console in Visual Studio
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

### NuGet Package Manager UI
Open the NuGet Package Manager within your IDE, search for "Aspose.Email", and click to install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
You can access a free trial of Aspose.Email to test its features. For extended use or production environments, consider purchasing a license or requesting a temporary one if you need more time to evaluate the library.

#### Basic Initialization
To get started, initialize the EWS client with your credentials and server URL:

```csharp
string address = "your.email@example.com";
string serverUrl = "https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx";
string username = "testUser";
string password = "pwd";
string domain = "domain";

IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(serverUrl, username, password, domain);
```

## Implementation Guide
We’ll break down the implementation into two main features: creating a test message and sending it with voting options.

### Create Test Message
#### Overview
Firstly, let’s create a simple `MailMessage` object. This foundational step sets up your email's basic structure including sender, recipient, subject, and body.

#### Implementation Steps
##### Define the Email Structure
Create a method to encapsulate the creation of your test message:

```csharp
private static MailMessage CreateTestMessage(string address)
{
    // Initialize a new instance of MailMessage with sender, recipient, subject, and body.
    MailMessage eml = new MailMessage(
        address,  // Sender's email address
        address,  // Recipient's email address
        "Flagged message",  // Subject line
        "Make it nice and short, but descriptive. The description may appear in search engines' search results pages..."
    );

    return eml;
}
```

**Explanation:** This method creates an instance of `MailMessage` with the specified parameters.

### Send Message with Voting Options
#### Overview
Now that we have our email ready, let's add voting options to engage recipients and gather their feedback efficiently.

#### Implementation Steps
##### Configure FollowUpOptions with Voting Buttons
Set up your follow-up options by specifying the voting buttons:

```csharp
FollowUpOptions options = new FollowUpOptions();
options.VotingButtons = "Yes;No;Maybe;Exactly!";
```

**Explanation:** `VotingButtons` allows you to define custom responses for recipients, enhancing interactivity.

##### Send the Email
Finally, use the `IEWSClient` instance to send your message:

```csharp
client.Send(message, options);
```

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure that all credentials and server URLs are correct. Common issues include authentication failures or network connectivity problems.

## Practical Applications
The capability to add voting options in emails can be utilized in various scenarios:

1. **Project Approval Processes:** Gather quick consensus from team members on project proposals.
2. **Customer Feedback Collection:** Use in marketing campaigns to understand customer preferences.
3. **Internal Surveys:** Conduct polls within your organization for decision-making or gathering insights.

## Performance Considerations
When implementing Aspose.Email functionalities, consider these performance tips:
- Optimize resource usage by disposing of email objects after sending them.
- Manage memory efficiently by handling large attachments and HTML content thoughtfully.
- Regularly update to the latest library version for improvements and security patches.
