### Using the .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

### Using Package Manager Console
```powershell

```

### Through NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version directly in your IDE.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
After installation, initialize your ExchangeClient with appropriate credentials:

```

## Implementation Guide

### List Emails Received Today
**Overview:** Quickly identify emails that arrived today to prioritize tasks or follow-ups.

#### Step 1: Create MailQueryBuilder Instance
```csharp
MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
builder.InternalDate.On(DateTime.Now);
```
Here, `InternalDate.On(DateTime.Now)` filters messages sent on the current date.

#### Step 2: Execute Query
```csharp
MailQuery query = builder.GetQuery();
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```
This retrieves and lists today's emails in your inbox.

### List Emails Over a Date Range
**Overview:** Filter emails received within the last 7 days to review recent communications efficiently.

#### Step 1: Build Query for Date Range
```csharp
builder.InternalDate.Before(DateTime.Now);
builder.InternalDate.Since(DateTime.Now.AddDays(-7));
```
This sets up a filter for emails from the past week.

#### Step 2: Retrieve and List Messages
```csharp
query = builder.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

### List Emails from a Specific Sender
**Overview:** Isolate messages sent by particular individuals or addresses for focused review.

#### Step 1: Specify the Sender in Query Builder
```csharp
builder.From.Contains("saqib.razzaq@127.0.0.1");
```
Use `Contains` to match email sender addresses.

#### Step 2: Fetch Messages
```csharp
query = builder.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

### List Emails from a Specific Domain
**Overview:** Streamline processing by filtering emails originating from a specific domain.

#### Step 1: Configure Query for Domain
```csharp
builder.From.Contains("SpecificHost.com");
```
Filter messages that are sent from the specified domain.

#### Step 2: Execute and Get Messages
```csharp
query = builder.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

### List Emails Sent to a Specific Recipient
**Overview:** Identify emails addressed to you or another specific recipient for targeted response actions.

#### Step 1: Set Up Query for Recipient
```csharp
builder.To.Contains("recipient");
```
This filters messages where the specified recipient is in the "To" field.

#### Step 2: Retrieve Messages
```csharp
query = builder.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

### List Emails with a Specific Message ID
**Overview:** Locate emails by unique message identifiers for precise tracking or follow-up.

#### Step 1: Configure Query by Message ID
```csharp
ExchangeQueryBuilder builder1 = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
builder1.MessageId.Equals("MessageID");
```
This filters messages based on their unique identifier.

#### Step 2: Fetch and List Messages
```csharp
query = builder1.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

### List Mail Delivery Notifications
**Overview:** Monitor email delivery statuses to ensure successful communication or troubleshoot issues.

#### Step 1: Set Up Query for MDNs (Mail Delivery Notifications)
```csharp
ExchangeQueryBuilder builder1 = new ExchangeQueryBuilder();
builder1.ContentClass.Equals(ContentClassType.MDN.ToString());
```
This targets messages with specific content classes, such as MDNs.

#### Step 2: Execute and Get Results
```csharp
query = builder1.GetQuery();
messages = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, query, false);
```

## Practical Applications
These features can be leveraged in numerous ways:
- **Customer Support:** Quickly access recent customer queries sent over the past week.
- **Project Management:** Filter emails from team members or project stakeholders.
- **Security Monitoring:** Identify and analyze delivery notifications for potential issues.
- **Personal Organization:** Keep track of important communications by sender or date.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is key when working with large volumes of email data:
- **Batch Processing:** Retrieve messages in batches to avoid overloading memory.
- **Connection Management:** Ensure efficient use of network resources by managing connections appropriately.
- **Resource Cleanup:** Dispose of objects properly after processing to free up system resources.
