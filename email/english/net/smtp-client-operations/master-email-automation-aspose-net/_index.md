## Implementation Guide

### Sending Emails Using Aspose.Email for .NET

#### Overview
Automating email sending can streamline communication in your organization. This feature helps you send emails programmatically, reducing manual effort.

**Step 1: Set Up the Email Client**
Initialize your Exchange Web Service client using credentials and endpoint URL.

```csharp
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(
    "https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", 
    "testUser", 
    "pwd", 
    "domain"
);
```

**Step 2: Create and Send Emails**
Craft your email messages with unique subject lines and send them using the client.

```csharp
// Create a MailMessage instance
MailMessage message1 = new MailMessage("user@domain.com", "recipient@domain.com",
    "EMAILNET-34738 - " + Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),  
    "EMAILNET-34738 Sync Folder Items");

// Send the email
client.Send(message1);

// Repeat for additional emails
MailMessage message2 = new MailMessage("user@domain.com", "recipient@domain.com",
    "EMAILNET-34738 - " + Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),  
    "EMAILNET-34738 Sync Folder Items");
client.Send(message2);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure the `testUser` credentials have permissions to send emails.
- Verify network connectivity to the Exchange server.

### Listing and Synchronizing Emails in Exchange Inbox

#### Overview
Maintain an up-to-date inbox by listing messages and synchronizing folder items. This feature is essential for email management systems requiring real-time data access.

**Step 1: List Messages**
Retrieve all messages from your Exchange inbox using:

```csharp
ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCol = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri);
```

**Step 2: Synchronize Inbox Folder**
Keep track of changes by synchronizing the inbox folder, obtaining counts of new and changed items.

```csharp
SyncFolderResult result = client.SyncFolder(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, null);

// Example outputs (uncomment to use)
Console.WriteLine(result.NewItems.Count);
Console.WriteLine(result.ChangedItems.Count);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Confirm user permissions for reading and syncing messages.
- Handle exceptions related to network failures gracefully.
