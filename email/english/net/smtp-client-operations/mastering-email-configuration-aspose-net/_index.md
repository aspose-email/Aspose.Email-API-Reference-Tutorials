## Implementation Guide

### Mail Message Creation and Configuration

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to create a new email, customize its properties like sender, receiver, subject, priority, sensitivity, and delivery notifications, and save it as an EML file.

##### Step 1: Create a New Email Message
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using System;

// Initialize a new MailMessage instance
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@gmail.com"; // Set the sender's email address
message.To = "receiver@gmail.com"; // Set the receiver's email address
message.Subject = "Using MailMessage Features"; // Define the subject

// Set additional properties
message.Date = DateTime.Now; // Current time as message date
message.Priority = MailPriority.High; // Email priority set to High
message.Sensitivity = MailSensitivity.Normal; // Normal sensitivity level
message.DeliveryNotificationOptions = DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnSuccess; // Enable success notification
```

##### Step 2: Save the Message
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
message.Save(outputDir + "/UseMailMessageFeatures_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```
- **SaveOptions.DefaultEml**: This option saves the email in a default EML format.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
Ensure your `outputDir` path is correctly set to avoid file-saving errors. Always handle exceptions during file operations for robust error management.

### Email Message Date Configuration

#### Overview
Learn how to set and retrieve the date of an email message using Aspose.Email.

##### Step 1: Set Message Date
```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@gmail.com";
message.To = "receiver@gmail.com";

// Assign current time as message date
message.Date = DateTime.Now;
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve and Display Date
```csharp
DateTime messageDate = message.Date; // Fetch the set date for demonstration

string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
message.Save(outputDir + "/EmailMessageDate_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

### Email Message Priority Configuration

#### Overview
This section focuses on setting the priority of an email, which can be useful to indicate the urgency of a message.

##### Step 1: Configure Priority
```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@gmail.com";
message.To = "receiver@gmail.com";

// Set priority to High
message.Priority = MailPriority.High;
```

##### Step 2: Save Message with Priority Configuration
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
message.Save(outputDir + "/EmailMessagePriority_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

### Email Message Sensitivity Configuration

#### Overview
This feature explains how to define the sensitivity of an email message.

##### Step 1: Set Message Sensitivity
```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@gmail.com";
message.To = "receiver@gmail.com";

// Set sensitivity level as Normal
message.Sensitivity = MailSensitivity.Normal;
```

##### Step 2: Save Configured Email
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
message.Save(outputDir + "/EmailMessageSensitivity_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

### Email Message Delivery Notification Configuration

#### Overview
Here, you'll learn how to set up delivery notifications for your emails.

##### Step 1: Configure Delivery Notifications
```csharp
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "sender@gmail.com";
message.To = "receiver@gmail.com";

// Enable success notification options
message.DeliveryNotificationOptions = DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnSuccess;
```

##### Step 2: Save Email with Notification Settings
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
message.Save(outputDir + "/EmailMessageDeliveryNotification_out.eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

## Practical Applications
