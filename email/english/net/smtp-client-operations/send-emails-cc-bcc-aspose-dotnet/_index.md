# How to Send Emails with CC/BCC Using Aspose.Email for .NET

In today's interconnected world, efficiently managing email communication is crucial. Whether it's coordinating a project or distributing newsletters, emails need to reach multiple recipients seamlessly. With the power of Aspose.Email for .NET, you can streamline this process by sending personalized messages with CC and BCC options, ensuring your emails are sent securely and reliably. This tutorial will guide you through setting up an email message and configuring an SMTP client using Aspose.Email for .NET.

## What You'll Learn:
- How to set up a basic email message with multiple recipients
- Configuring the SMTP client to send emails from your application
- Handling exceptions during email sending

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin setting things up.

### Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following in place:

- **Libraries and Dependencies**: You'll need the Aspose.Email for .NET library. This can be added via various package managers.
- **Development Environment**: A development setup with .NET installed is required. Visual Studio is recommended for ease of use.
- **Knowledge Base**: Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with SMTP configuration will help.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

To get started, you'll need to install the Aspose.Email library in your .NET project. Here's how you can do it using different package managers:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

You can start with a free trial to explore all features. For extended use, consider purchasing a license or acquiring a temporary one:
- **Free Trial**: Allows you to test Aspose.Email's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Ideal for evaluation purposes before purchase.
- **Purchase**: Available for full access and support.

Initialize your project by including the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Smtp;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, letâ€™s walk through the implementation process step-by-step.

### Setting Up Email Message

This feature enables you to create a detailed email message with multiple recipients, CC, and BCC. Here's how:

#### Creating an Instance of MailMessage
```csharp
// Initialize the MailMessage instance
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

#### Configuring Sender and Recipients
Set up the sender's details and specify the recipients.

```csharp
// Set sender information
message.From = "newcustomeronnet@gmail.com";
message.Subject = "Test Email";
message.Body = "Hello World!";

// Add multiple To addresses
message.To.Add("receiver1@receiver.com");
message.To.Add("receiver2@receiver.com");
message.To.Add("receiver3@receiver.com");
message.To.Add("receiver4@receiver.com");

// Configure CC and BCC addresses
message.CC.Add("CC1@receiver.com");
message.CC.Add("CC2@receiver.com");
message.Bcc.Add("Bcc1@receiver.com");
message.Bcc.Add("Bcc2@receiver.com");
```

### Configuring SMTP Client

This step involves setting up your `SmtpClient` to send emails through a specified server.

#### Initializing and Configuring SmtpClient
```csharp
// Create and configure the SMTP client
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 587, "your.email@gmail.com", "your.password");
client.SecurityOptions = SecurityOptions.Auto; // Auto-selects security options based on server capabilities.
```

### Sending Email Message

Finally, send your email message and handle any exceptions that might occur.

#### Executing the Send Method
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

try
{
    // Attempt to send the email
    client.Send(message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log any exceptions for debugging purposes
    Trace.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your SMTP credentials are correct.
- Verify that the server address and port are correctly configured.
- Check if security settings like SSL/TLS are supported by your email provider.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where this setup can be useful:
1. **Automated Notifications**: Send automated updates or alerts to multiple stakeholders in a project.
2. **Newsletter Distribution**: Manage mass emails for newsletters with CC and BCC options efficiently.
3. **Transactional Emails**: Implement systems that send transactional emails like order confirmations or password resets.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider the following:
- **Batch Processing**: Send bulk emails in batches to avoid server overload.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms for retries and logging.
- **Resource Management**: Dispose of `SmtpClient` and other resources properly after use to free up memory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how Aspose.Email for .NET can be used to send emails with multiple recipients, including CC and BCC. By configuring the SMTP client correctly, you ensure that your applications can handle email communication effectively. Next steps include exploring advanced features such as email attachments or integrating with CRM systems.
