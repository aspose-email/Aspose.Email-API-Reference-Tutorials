### Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize the library in your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;
```

This sets up Aspose.Email for integration with Exchange Web Services (EWS) for sending emails.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set everything up, let's dive into the implementation process. This section will guide you through creating and sending an email using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Sending Email Messages with Aspose.Email for .NET

#### Overview
This feature enables developers to send emails through Exchange Web Services using network credentials securely.

#### Step 1: Configure Network Credentials

First, create a `NetworkCredential` object. This ensures secure transmission of your username and password when connecting to the mail server:

```csharp
string mailboxUri = "https://exchange.domain.com/ews/Exchange.asmx";
string domain = @"";
string username = "username";
string password = "password";

// Create credentials
NetworkCredential credential = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
```

#### Step 2: Connect to the Email Client

Next, connect to your email server using `IEWSClient`, which provides methods for sending emails:

```csharp
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(mailboxUri, credential);
```

#### Step 3: Create and Send a Mail Message

Create a new `MailMessage` object specifying sender and recipient details. Then, send the email using the `IEWSClient.Send` method:

```csharp
// Create a mail message
MailMessage message = new MailMessage("user@domain.com", "recipient@domain.com")
{
    Subject = "Test Email",
    Body = "This is a test email sent using Aspose.Email for .NET."
};

// Send the email
client.Send(message);
```
**Parameters:**
- `mailboxUri`: The URI of your Exchange server.
- `credential`: Network credentials for authentication.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Authentication Errors:** Ensure your username and password are correct and have necessary permissions.
- **Network Issues:** Verify that your network settings allow connections to the specified mail server.
