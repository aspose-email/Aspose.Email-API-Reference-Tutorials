## Implementation Guide

### Creating a MailMessage

**Overview**: This section demonstrates how to construct an email with specified sender, receiver, and subject details.

#### Step 1: Instantiate the MailMessage Class
```csharp
// Create a new instance of the MailMessage class
MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();
```

#### Step 2: Set Sender, Receiver, and Subject
```csharp
msg.From = "sender@sender.com"; // Define the sender's email address
msg.To = "receiver@receiver.com"; // Specify the recipient's email address
msg.Subject = "the subject of the message"; // Set a meaningful subject line for your email
```

### Configuring Delivery Notifications

**Overview**: Learn to set delivery notifications that alert you upon successful or failed deliveries.

#### Step 3: Configure Delivery Notification Options
```csharp
// Enable delivery notifications for both success and failure scenarios
msg.DeliveryNotificationOptions = DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnSuccess | DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnFailure;
```

### Adding MIME Headers

**Overview**: This feature allows you to add custom headers, such as `Disposition-Notification-To`, to track email disposition.

#### Step 4: Add Custom Headers
```csharp
// Add a header for delivery notification when the recipient disposes of the message
msg.Headers.Add_("Disposition-Notification-To", "sender@sender.com");
```

### Sending an Email Message

**Overview**: Here, you'll learn how to send emails using `SmtpClient` with specified server details.

#### Step 5: Initialize and Configure SmtpClient
```csharp
// Create a new instance of SmtpClient with your SMTP server credentials
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("host", "username", "password");
```

#### Step 6: Send the Message
```csharp
// Execute sending the message through the configured SMTP server
client.Send(msg);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure correct server details are provided in `SmtpClient`.
- Verify network connectivity if you encounter connection issues.
