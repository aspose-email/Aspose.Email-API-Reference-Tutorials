using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Connecting to Exchange Server Using EWS
Connecting to the server is crucial for managing emails programmatically.

#### Steps:
**Step 1: Create an Instance of the EWS Client**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;

public static void ConnectToExchangeServer()
{
    // Create an instance of the EWS client with server URL, username, password, and domain
    IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(
        "https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", 
        "testUser", 
        "pwd", 
        "domain");
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `GetEWSClient` initializes a connection using the provided credentials.

### Creating and Appending a New Email Message
Learn how to craft an email message and append it to your server.

#### Steps:
**Step 1: Create a MailMessage Object**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;

public static void CreateAndAppendEmail(IEWSClient client)
{
    // Create a new MailMessage object
    MailMessage message = new MailMessage(
        "from@domain.com", 
        "to@domain.com", 
        "EMAILNET-34997 - " + Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), 
        "EMAILNET-34997 Exchange: Copy a message and get reference to the new Copy item");

    // Append the created email message to the server
    string messageUri = client.AppendMessage(message);
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `MailMessage` represents an email with sender, recipient, subject, and body.
- `AppendMessage` stores the message on the server.

### Copying an Email Message to Another Folder
Efficiently organize your emails by copying them between folders using their URI.

#### Steps:
**Step 1: Use IEWSClient to Copy an Email**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;

public static void CopyEmailMessage(IEWSClient client, string messageUri)
{
    // Copy an email message to the DeletedItems folder
    string newMessageUri = client.CopyItem(
        messageUri, 
        client.MailboxInfo.DeletedItemsUri);
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `CopyItem` moves a message from its current location to another folder.
