## Implementation Guide

### Connect to Exchange Server using EWSClient

**Overview**: Establish a connection with an Exchange server using Aspose.Email's `EWSClient`.

#### Step 1: Set Up Credentials
Configure the network credentials used for authentication with the Exchange server:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;

const string mailboxUri = "https://exchange/ews/exchange.asmx";
const string domain = "";
const string username = "username@ASE305.onmicrosoft.com";
const string password = "password";

// Creating NetworkCredential object with user credentials
NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
```

#### Step 2: Connect to the Exchange Server
Using `EWSClient`, connect to your mailbox:
```csharp
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(mailboxUri, credentials);
Console.WriteLine("Connected to Exchange Server");
```

### Find and Delete Specific Conversations

**Overview**: Retrieve conversations from the inbox and delete those matching specific criteria.

#### Step 1: Retrieve All Conversation Items
Fetch all conversation items in your Inbox folder:
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange.WebService;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

// Fetching conversations from the Inbox
ExchangeConversation[] conversations = client.FindConversations(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri);
```

#### Step 2: Check Conversation Topic and Delete
Iterate through each conversation to find those that meet your criteria:
```csharp
foreach (ExchangeConversation conversation in conversations)
{
    // Check if the conversation topic contains a specific string
    if (conversation.ConversationTopic.Contains("test email"))
    {
        // Deleting conversation items based on condition
        client.DeleteConversationItems(conversation.ConversationId);
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your credentials and Exchange server URL are correct.
