## Implementation Guide
### Creating and Appending Messages to Exchange Server
#### Overview
Automating email creation and appending them to your Exchange server streamlines communication. This section demonstrates how to use Aspose.Email for .NET to achieve this efficiently.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
**1. Connect to the Exchange Server:**
```csharp
var client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient("exchange.domain.com", "username", "password");
```
This step establishes a connection with your Exchange server using the provided credentials.

**2. Create and Append Emails:**
Here's how you can create multiple messages and append them to your inbox:
```csharp
int messagesNum = 12;
for (int i = 0; i < messagesNum; i++) {
    var message = new MailMessage(
        "from@domain.com",
        "to@domain.com",
        $"EMAILNET-35157_1 - {Guid.NewGuid()}",
        "EMAILNET-35157 Move paging parameters to separate class");
    client.AppendMessage(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, message);
}
```
**Explanation:**
- **MailMessage:** Create a new email with the sender, recipient, subject, and body.
- **AppendMessage:** Appends the created message to your inbox on the Exchange server.

### Verifying Messages on Exchange Server
#### Overview
After appending messages, it's essential to verify that they are stored correctly. This section guides you through verifying the number of emails in an inbox.

**1. List All Messages:**
```csharp
var client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient("exchange.domain.com", "username", "password");
var totalMessageInfoCol = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri);
int messageCount = totalMessageInfoCol.Count;
```
**Explanation:**
- **ListMessages:** Retrieves all messages from the inbox.
- **Count:** Provides the total number of messages, allowing you to verify successful appending.

### Retrieving Messages Using Paging Support
#### Overview
Efficiently retrieving emails using paging helps manage large datasets. This section demonstrates how to implement paging when fetching emails from an Exchange server.

**1. Set Up Paging Parameters:**
```csharp
var client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient("exchange.domain.com", "username", "password");
int itemsPerPage = 5;
List<ExchangeMessagePageInfo> pages = new List<ExchangeMessagePageInfo>();
```
**2. Retrieve Messages in Pages:**
```csharp
ExchangeMessagePageInfo pageInfo = client.ListMessagesByPage(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, itemsPerPage);
pages.Add(pageInfo);

while (!pageInfo.LastPage) {
    pageInfo = client.ListMessagesByPage(client.MailboxInfo.InboxUri, itemsPerPage, pageInfo.PageOffset + 1);
    pages.Add(pageInfo);
}

int retrievedItems = 0;
foreach (ExchangeMessagePageInfo pageCol in pages) {
    retrievedItems += pageCol.Items.Count;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- **ListMessagesByPage:** Retrieves messages in specified page sizes.
- **LastPage & PageOffset:** Manage pagination to handle large volumes of emails efficiently.
