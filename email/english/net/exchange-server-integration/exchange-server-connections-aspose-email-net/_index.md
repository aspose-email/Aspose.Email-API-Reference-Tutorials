NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential("username", "password");
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(mailboxUri, credentials);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Connect to Exchange Server Using EWS Client

#### Overview
Establishing a connection with an Exchange server is crucial for accessing and managing email data programmatically.

#### Step-by-Step Guide
**1. Define Credentials**
Set up your network credentials, including username, password, and domain (if applicable).
```csharp
const string mailboxUri = "https://exchange/ews/exchange.asmx";
const string domain = @"";
const string username = "username@ASE305.onmicrosoft.com";
const string password = "password";
NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
```

**2. Establish Connection**
Use the `EWSClient.GetEWSClient` method to connect to your Exchange server.
```csharp
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(mailboxUri, credentials);
```

### List Messages from Deleted Items Folder

#### Overview
Retrieving messages from specific folders helps manage and analyze email data efficiently. We'll focus on the Deleted Items folder for this tutorial.

**3. Retrieve Emails**
Once connected, use the `ListMessages` method to access emails in the Deleted Items folder.
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Exchange;
using System.Collections.Generic;

ExchangeMessageInfoCollection list = client.ListMessages(client.MailboxInfo.DeletedItemsUri);

// Iterate and display message types.
foreach (var messageInfo in list)
{
    Console.WriteLine(messageInfo.MessageInfoType.ToString());
}
```

#### Explanation
- **`ListMessages`**: Retrieves a collection of messages from the specified folder URI.
- **Message Info Type**: Provides information about each message, such as whether it's an email or calendar item.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your credentials are correct and have necessary permissions.
- Check network connectivity to avoid connection issues with the Exchange server.
- Verify Aspose.Email is correctly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
Explore real-world scenarios where these functionalities shine:
1. **Automated Email Archiving**: Move emails from active folders to an archive for long-term storage.
2. **Email Auditing**: Retrieve deleted items for compliance or auditing purposes.
3. **Data Migration**: Migrate emails between different mailboxes or servers using the EWS client.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Queries**: Limit data retrieval by specifying filters or parameters.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects promptly to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large volumes of email data in batches to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

## Conclusion
This tutorial explored connecting to an Exchange server using Aspose.Email for .NET and retrieving emails from specific folders. These capabilities allow you to automate and streamline your email management processes efficiently.
