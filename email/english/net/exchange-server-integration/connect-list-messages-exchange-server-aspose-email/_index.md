        // Initialize EWS client with credentials
        IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
        
        System.out.println("Connected to Exchange Server successfully!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Connect to Exchange Server
#### Overview
This feature allows you to connect to an Exchange server and perform operations like reading emails or managing folders.
##### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Ensure the necessary classes are imported at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.email.IEWSClient;
import com.aspose.email.EWSClient;
```
##### Step 2: Establish Connection
Create an instance of `IEWSClient` using your Exchange server's URL, username, password, and domain:
```java
IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
```
##### Step 3: Verify Connection
Check if the connection is established successfully by printing a confirmation message.

### List Messages from a Folder
#### Overview
Once connected, list messages from various folders within your Exchange mailbox for email management and processing tasks.
##### Step 1: Obtain Folder URIs
Retrieve URI strings for different mailbox folders:
```java
String inboxUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getInboxUri();
String deletedItemsUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getDeletedItemsUri();
String draftsUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getDraftsUri();
String sentItemsUri = client.getMailboxInfo().getSentItemsUri();
```
##### Step 2: List Messages
Use the `listMessages` method to fetch messages from a specified folder:
```java
import com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfoCollection;

ExchangeMessageInfoCollection inboxMessages = client.listMessages(inboxUri);
// Repeat for other folders as needed.
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Invalid Credentials:** Double-check the username, password, and domain details.
- **Network Issues:** Ensure your network allows connections to Exchange servers.
- **Library Compatibility:** Verify you're using a compatible version of Aspose.Email.

## Practical Applications
1. **Email Management Systems:** Automate email sorting and processing in corporate environments.
2. **Customer Support Tools:** Streamline support ticket creation by integrating with email systems.
3. **Data Migration Projects:** Facilitate the migration of emails from one server to another.
Integration possibilities include connecting with CRM systems, logging tools, or custom notification services for enhanced workflow automation.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance:
- Minimize API calls by batching requests when possible.
- Manage memory effectively by disposing of objects no longer in use.
- Use asynchronous methods where applicable to improve responsiveness.
Adhering to these best practices will help you leverage Aspose.Email efficiently within your applications.
