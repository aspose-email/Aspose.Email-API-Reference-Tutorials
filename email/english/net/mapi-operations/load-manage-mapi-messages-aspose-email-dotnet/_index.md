## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into two main features: Loading MAPI Messages and Managing PST Files.

### Feature 1: Loading MAPI Message

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to load a MAPI message from a file, essential for processing saved email messages or notes in your application.

#### Steps to Implement

**Step 1: Load a MAPI Message**
Specify the directory where your `Note.msg` file is located and load it using Aspose.Email:
```csharp
string dataDir = \@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
MapiMessage mess = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "Note.msg");
```

**Step 2: Create and Customize Notes**
Convert the loaded message into multiple notes with different properties:
```csharp
// Create a Yellow Note
MapiNote note1 = (MapiNote)mess.ToMapiMessageItem();
note1.Subject = "Yellow color note";
note1.Body = "This is a yellow color note";

// Create a Pink Note
MapiNote note2 = (MapiNote)mess.ToMapiMessageItem();
note2.Subject = "Pink color note";
note2.Body = "This is a pink color note";
note2.Color = NoteColor.Pink;

// Create a Blue Note with Dimensions
MapiNote note3 = (MapiNote)mess.ToMapiMessageItem();
note3.Subject = "Blue color note";
note3.Body = "This is a blue color note";
note3.Color = NoteColor.Blue;
note3.Height = 500;
note3.Width = 500;
```

### Feature 2: Creating and Managing Personal Storage File (PST)

#### Overview
Learn how to create a PST file, add folders, and insert MAPI messages. This is crucial for applications that need to store emails locally.

#### Steps to Implement

**Step 1: Set Up the Output Path**
Define where your output PST file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputPath = \@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\AddMapiNoteToPST_out.pst";

// Ensure no existing file conflicts by deleting if it exists.
if (File.Exists(outputPath))
{
    File.Delete(outputPath);
}
```

**Step 2: Create and Organize PST**
Initialize a new PST and create folders:
```csharp
using (PersonalStorage personalStorage = PersonalStorage.Create(outputPath, FileFormatVersion.Unicode))
{
    // Create a 'Notes' folder to store your notes.
    FolderInfo notesFolder = personalStorage.CreatePredefinedFolder("Notes\
