## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load and Save MAPI Messages with Attachments

This feature demonstrates how to load a MAPI message from a file and save it with attachments using Aspose.Email for .NET.

#### Overview
The purpose of this feature is to manage MAPI messages by loading them into your application, saving them as needed, and ensuring all attachments are intact.

#### Step 1: Load a MAPI Message from File
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;
using System;

class FeatureLoadAndSaveMAPI
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        // Define the directory path where the input file is located
        string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";  // Update this with your actual document directory

        // Load a MAPI message from file.
        MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/MsgWithAtt.msg");
        
        Console.WriteLine("MAPI message loaded successfully.");
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This snippet loads the MAPI message from a specified directory. Ensure `dataDir` is correctly set to your environment.

#### Step 2: Save the Loaded MAPI Message with Attachments
```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    // Define the directory path where the input file is located
    string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";  // Update this with your actual document directory

    // Load a MAPI message from file.
    MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/MsgWithAtt.msg");

    // Save the loaded MAPI message to another file with attachments.
    string outputFilePath = dataDir + "/AttachmentsToDestroy_out.msg";
    msg.Save(outputFilePath);

    Console.WriteLine("MAPI message saved successfully.");
}
```
**Explanation:** Here, we save the loaded message to a new file. This ensures that all attachments are preserved during the saving process.

### Feature 2: Destroy Attachments in a MAPI Message

This feature shows how to remove all attachments from a specified MAPI message file effectively.

#### Overview
Removing unnecessary attachments can help streamline your email management and reduce storage requirements.

#### Step 1: Specify the File with Attachments
```csharp
using Aspose.Email.Mapi;
using System;

class FeatureDestroyAttachments
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        // Define the directory path where the output file is located
        string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";  // Update this with your actual document directory

        // Specify the MAPI message file from which to destroy attachments.
        string filePath = dataDir + "/AttachmentsToDestroy_out.msg";
        
        Console.WriteLine("File specified for attachment removal.");
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This step sets up the path to your target file, ensuring you're working with the correct file.

#### Step 2: Remove All Attachments from the File
```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    // Define the directory path where the output file is located
    string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";  // Update this with your actual document directory

    // Specify the MAPI message file from which to destroy attachments.
    string filePath = dataDir + "/AttachmentsToDestroy_out.msg";
    
    // Call the static method to remove all attachments from the specified file.
    MapiMessage.DestroyAttachments(filePath);

    Console.WriteLine("All attachments removed successfully.");
}
```
**Explanation:** The `MapiMessage.DestroyAttachments` method efficiently clears all attachments, ensuring your message is clean and streamlined.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly defined to avoid file not found errors.
- Check Aspose.Email version compatibility with your .NET environment.
- Use appropriate error handling for robust applications.
