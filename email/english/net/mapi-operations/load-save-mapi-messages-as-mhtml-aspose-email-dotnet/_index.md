# How to Load and Save MAPI Messages as MHTML Using Aspose.Email for .NET

## Introduction
Managing email messages programmatically can be challenging, especially with complex formats like MAPI. However, with Aspose.Email for .NET, you can easily load these messages from files and save them in a web-friendly MHT (MIME HTML) format.

This guide will walk you through using Aspose.Email for .NET to convert MAPI messages into MHTML format. You'll learn how to configure save options and execute file operations efficiently.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Email for .NET in your development environment.
- Loading MAPI messages using the `MapiMessage` class.
- Configuring custom HTML templates for saving in MHT format.
- Saving MAPI messages as MHTML files with tailored options.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To follow this tutorial, you'll need:
- **Aspose.Email for .NET**: Ensure you have version 22.10 or later installed.
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+**: Depending on your project setup.

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your development environment supports .NET projects. You can use Visual Studio, VS Code with the C# extension, or any IDE that supports .NET development.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of:
- C# programming.
- Handling files and directories in .NET.
- Working with third-party libraries.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET
Getting started with Aspose.Email is straightforward. Here's how to install it:

**Using the .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
1. Open the NuGet Package Manager.
2. Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To start using Aspose.Email, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial license to test all features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full-feature access without evaluation limitations.
- **Purchase**: Buy a subscription if you're ready to integrate it into your production environment.

Once installed, initialize the library by including necessary namespaces in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using System;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load MAPI Message from File

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to load a MAPI message from a specified file path using Aspose.Email, crucial for processing emails stored as MAPI messages.

#### Steps to Implement
**Step 1**: Define the Directory Path
Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with your actual directory where the `MapiTask.msg` file is located.
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document directory path
```
**Step 2**: Load the MAPI Message
Use the `MapiMessage.FromFile()` method to load the message, creating a `MapiMessage` object from it.
```csharp
// Load the MapiMessage from the specified file
dynamic msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "MapiTask.msg");
```

### Feature 2: Configure MHT Save Options

#### Overview
Configuring save options allows you to customize how your MAPI message is saved in MHTML format. This step involves setting templates and format options.

#### Steps to Implement
**Step 1**: Initialize `MhtSaveOptions`
Set up the default MHTML save options, which will be modified for custom output.
```csharp
dynamic opt = SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml;
```
**Step 2**: Set Format Options
Enable rendering of task fields and header information in your saved MHTML file.
```csharp
opt.MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.RenderTaskFields | MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader;
```
**Step 3**: Customize Templates
Define HTML templates for various task properties to control their appearance in the output file.
```csharp
// Clear existing templates
opt.FormatTemplates.Clear();

// Add custom HTML templates for specific task properties
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.Subject, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Subject:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.ActualWork, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Actual Work:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.TotalWork, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Total Work:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.Status, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Status:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.Owner, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Owner:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
opt.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Task.Priority, "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Priority:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
```

### Feature 3: Save MAPI Message as MHTML File

#### Overview
Once configured, save your loaded MAPI message to an MHTML file. This step finalizes the conversion process using previously set options.

#### Steps to Implement
**Step 1**: Define Output File Path
Specify where you want to save the converted MHTML file.
```csharp
string outputFile = dataDir + "MapiTask_out.mht";
```
**Step 2**: Save the Message
Use the `Save()` method with your configured options to convert and store the message in MHTML format.
```csharp
// Save the message to an MHT file using previously configured options
dynamic msg.Save(outputFile, opt);
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Email Archiving**: Archive emails from legacy systems by converting them into a web-friendly MHTML format.
2. **Integration with Task Management Systems**: Convert task-related MAPI messages for use in modern project management applications that support HTML formats.
3. **Documenting and Sharing**: Generate shareable reports of email tasks in an accessible format, perfect for documentation or collaboration.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimizing Performance
- Load only necessary files to reduce memory usage.
- Use asynchronous methods where possible to avoid blocking operations.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Monitor the application's memory footprint when handling large volumes of messages.
- Dispose of objects properly after use to free up resources.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management with Aspose.Email
- Utilize `using` statements to automatically dispose of objects.
- Regularly update Aspose.Email to leverage improvements and optimizations in newer versions.
