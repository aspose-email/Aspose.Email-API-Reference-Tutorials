## Implementation Guide

### Creating and Configuring MAPI Messages

#### Overview
Creating a new MAPI message involves initializing it with sender, recipient details, subject, and body. We will also explore how to set specific flags and properties.

#### Step 1: Create a New MAPI Message
Create an instance of `MapiMessage`:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document directory path

// Initialize the message
double time = DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.TotalSeconds;
string uniqueSubject = $"Unique Subject {time}";

MapiMessage msg = new MapiMessage(
    "from@test.com",
    "to@test.com",
    uniqueSubject,
    "Make it nice and short, but descriptive. The description may appear in search engines' search results pages..."
);
```

#### Step 2: Configure Message Flags
Optionally, you can simulate the email as sent by toggling specific flags:

```csharp
bool draft = false; // Set to true if you want a draft
if (!draft) {
    msg.SetMessageFlags(msg.Flags ^ MapiMessageFlags.MSGFLAG_UNSENT);
}
```

#### Step 3: Save the Message
Save your message to a specified directory:

```csharp
msg.Save(dataDir + "/MapiMsgExample.msg");
```

### Setting and Removing Voting Buttons from MAPI Messages

#### Overview
Adding voting buttons can enhance interactive emails. We'll cover adding and removing these options.

#### Step 1: Create or Load an Existing Message
Create a new message with follow-up options:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document directory path

MapiMessage msgWithPoll = new MapiMessage(
    "from@test.com",
    "to@test.com",
    "Voting Message",
    "Select your option."
);
```

#### Step 2: Set Voting Buttons
Configure voting options using `FollowUpOptions`:

```csharp
FollowUpOptions options = new FollowUpOptions();
options.VotingButtons = "Yes;No;Maybe;Exactly!";
FollowUpManager.SetOptions(msgWithPoll, options);

msgWithPoll.Save(dataDir + "/MapiMsgWithPoll.msg");
```

#### Step 3: Remove Voting Buttons
You can remove specific or all voting buttons:

```csharp
// To remove a specific button
FollowUpManager.RemoveVotingButton(msgWithPoll, "Exactly!");

// Or clear all voting buttons
FollowUpManager.ClearVotingButtons(msgWithPoll);
```

#### Step 4: Save the Updated Message
Ensure you save your changes:

```csharp
msgWithPoll.Save(dataDir + "/MapiMsgUpdated.msg");
```
