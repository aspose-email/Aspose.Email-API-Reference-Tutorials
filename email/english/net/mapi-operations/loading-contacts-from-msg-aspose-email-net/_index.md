## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into manageable sections to load contacts from MSG files using Aspose.Email for .NET.

### Loading Contacts from an MSG File

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to extract contact details stored in an Outlook MSG file by converting it to a MapiContact object.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Define the Path to Your Document Directory**
Before loading any files, specify where your MSG files are located:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```
Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your files.

**Step 2: Load the MSG File into a MapiMessage Object**
To read an MSG file, use the `MapiMessage.FromFile` method. This step involves specifying the file path and loading it:
```csharp
// Load an MSG file into MapiMessage object.
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.FromFile(dataDir + "/Contact.msg");
```
**Step 3: Convert MapiMessage to MapiContact**
Once the MSG file is loaded, convert it to a `MapiContact` object for easier access to contact details:
```csharp
// Convert the MapiMessage to MapiContact object.
MapiContact mapiContact = (MapiContact)msg.ToMapiMessageItem();
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your MSG file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that Aspose.Email for .NET is properly installed and licensed.
