## Implementation Guide

### Setting Voting Options in MAPI Messages

#### Overview
This feature lets you add voting options to your emails, facilitating decision-making directly within the communication thread. 

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Step 1: Create a New `MapiMessage`**
Start by defining a new `MapiMessage` instance with sender, recipient, subject, and body:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
MapiMessage msg = new MapiMessage(
    "from@test.com",
    "to@test.com",
    "Flagged message",
    "Make it nice and short, but descriptive. The description may appear in search engines' search results pages...");
```

**Step 2: Configure `FollowUpOptions`**
Set up the `FollowUpOptions` to include your desired voting buttons:
```csharp
FollowUpOptions options = new FollowUpOptions();
options.VotingButtons = "Yes;No;Maybe;Exactly!";
```

**Step 3: Apply Options and Save the Message**
Apply these settings using `FollowUpManager` and save the message:
```csharp
FollowUpManager.SetOptions(msg, options);
msg.Save(dataDir + @"\MapiMsgWithPoll.msg");
```

#### Parameters and Methods
- **VotingButtons**: String defining available voting options.
- **SetOptions**: Applies follow-up configurations to your message.

### Creating a Test MAPI Message
This feature helps create test messages for verifying the setup without sending real emails. Here's how you can implement it:

**Step 1: Define `CreateTestMessage` Method**
```csharp
private static MapiMessage CreateTestMessage(bool draft)
{
    MapiMessage msg = new MapiMessage(
        "from@test.com",
        "to@test.com",
        "Flagged message",
        "Make it nice and short, but descriptive. The description may appear in search engines' search results pages...");

    if (!draft)
    {
        msg.SetMessageFlags(msg.Flags ^ MapiMessageFlags.MSGFLAG_UNSENT);
    }

    return msg;
}
```

**Parameters:**
- **draft**: Boolean flag to determine if the message is a draft or ready to send.

## Practical Applications
1. **Team Decision-Making**: Quickly gather team consensus on projects via email.
2. **Customer Surveys**: Engage customers by incorporating feedback options directly in follow-up emails.
3. **Meeting Agendas**: Use voting buttons for pre-meeting agenda approval.

Integrating Aspose.Email with other systems like CRM platforms can enhance data collection and analysis capabilities, providing valuable insights into team dynamics or customer preferences.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- Minimize message size by reducing unnecessary metadata.
- Utilize efficient loops and conditional statements within your code to handle large email batches effectively.

### Resource Usage Guidelines
Monitor system resources when processing a high volume of emails. Adjust threading and memory allocation as needed for optimal performance.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
- Dispose of `MapiMessage` objects after use with `Dispose()` or using `using` statements.
- Regularly update Aspose.Email to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
