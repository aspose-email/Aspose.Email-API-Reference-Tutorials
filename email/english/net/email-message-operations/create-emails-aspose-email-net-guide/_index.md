In this section, we'll walk through creating an email message using Aspose.Email. Each feature will be broken down into actionable steps.

### Creating a New Email Message

#### Overview
We begin by initializing a new instance of the `MailMessage` class to create our email.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document directory path

// Step 1: Create a new instance of the MailMessage class
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

#### Setting the Subject and Body

Next, set the email's subject and enable HTML content to create rich text emails.

```csharp
// Step 2: Set the subject of the email
message.Subject = "New message created by Aspose.Email for .NET";

// Step 3: Enable HTML body and set HTML content
message.IsBodyHtml = true;
message.HtmlBody = "<b>This line is in bold.</b> <br/> <br/><font color=blue>This line is in blue color</font>";
```

#### Configuring Sender and Recipients
Set the sender's email address and add recipients to the message.

```csharp
// Step 4: Set the sender's email address
message.From = "from@domain.com";

// Step 5: Add TO recipients to the message
message.To.Add("to1@domain.com");
message.To.Add("to2@domain.com");

// Step 6: Add CC recipients to the message
message.CC.Add("cc1@domain.com");
message.CC.Add("cc2@domain.com");
```

#### Saving in Various Formats
Finally, save your email in different formats for versatility.

```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your output directory path

// Step 7: Save the email in different formats (EML, MSG, MHTML)
message.Save(outputDir + "/CreateNewEmail_out.eml", Aspose.Email.SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
message.Save(outputDir + "/CreateNewEmail_out.msg", Aspose.Email.SaveOptions.DefaultMsgUnicode);
message.Save(outputDir + "/CreateNewEmail_out.mhtml", Aspose.Email.SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml);
