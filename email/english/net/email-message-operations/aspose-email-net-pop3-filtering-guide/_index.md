using Aspose.Email.Clients.Pop3;
```
## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into clear, actionable steps based on specific features.
### Feature 1: Connect to a POP3 Server
**Overview**: This section will guide you through establishing a connection to your POP3 email server using Aspose.Email.
#### Step 1: Define Connection Settings
Start by specifying your server's details:
```csharp
const string host = "your.pop3.server.com"; // Replace with actual server address
const int port = 110; // Standard POP3 port, adjust if needed
const string username = "user@domain.com"; // Your email username
const string password = "securepassword"; // Your email password
```
#### Step 2: Initialize Pop3Client
Create an instance of `Pop3Client` with the specified parameters:
```csharp
Pop3Client client = new Pop3Client(host, port, username, password);
```
### Feature 2: Build Email Query for Filtering
**Overview**: Learn how to construct queries to filter emails based on specific criteria.
#### Step 1: Initialize MailQueryBuilder
Create an instance of `MailQueryBuilder`:
```csharp
MailQueryBuilder builder = new MailQueryBuilder();
```
#### Step 2: Define Filter Criteria
Specify the conditions for filtering emails, such as subject and date:
```csharp
builder.Subject.Contains("Newsletter");
builder.InternalDate.On(DateTime.Now);
```
#### Step 3: Generate Query Object
Convert your criteria into a query object:
```csharp
MailQuery query = builder.GetQuery();
```
### Feature 3: Retrieve Filtered Emails from POP3 Server
**Overview**: This feature demonstrates how to fetch emails that match the predefined query.
Assuming you have already connected via `Pop3Client`, proceed with these steps:
#### Step 1: Use Client to List Messages
Utilize your client instance to retrieve messages based on the query:
```csharp
Pop3MessageInfoCollection messages = client.ListMessages(query);
```
## Practical Applications
Understanding how to connect and filter emails can be applied in various scenarios, such as:
- **Automated Newsletters**: Quickly sort and manage newsletters for a marketing team.
