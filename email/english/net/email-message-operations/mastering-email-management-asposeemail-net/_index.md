## Implementation Guide

### Create and Append Email Message
Creating an email message and appending it to your IMAP mailbox is straightforward with Aspose.Email. This feature lets you automate sending or organizing emails.

#### Overview
In this section, we'll cover how to create a new `MailMessage` object and append it to the Inbox folder of an IMAP server.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Set Up ImapClient**
Start by configuring your `ImapClient` with necessary credentials:
```csharp
ImapClient client = new ImapClient();
client.Host = "imap.gmail.com"; // Use your IMAP host here
client.Username = "your.username@gmail.com";
client.Password = "your.password";
client.Port = 993; // SSL port for Gmail
client.SecurityOptions = SecurityOptions.Auto;
```
**2. Create and Append Email**
Create a `MailMessage` instance with sender, recipient, subject, and body:
```csharp
try
{
    MailMessage message = new MailMessage("user@domain1.com", "user@domain2.com", "subject", "message");
    
    // Append the email to the Inbox folder
    string uid = client.AppendMessage(ImapFolderInfo.InBox, message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.Write(Environment.NewLine + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    client.Dispose();
}
```
### Add Custom Flags to Email Message
Custom flags can help you categorize or mark emails for specific actions within your application.

#### Overview
Learn how to add custom flags to an email message using its UID in the IMAP mailbox.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Select Inbox Folder**
Ensure that the folder is ready for flag operations:
```csharp
client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
```
**2. Add Flags by UID**
Add custom flags to a specified message identified by its unique identifier (UID):
```csharp
try
{
    string uid = "some-unique-message-id";  // Replace with actual UID
    
    client.AddMessageFlags(uid, ImapMessageFlags.Keyword("custom1") | ImapMessageFlags.Keyword("custom1_0"));
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.Write(Environment.NewLine + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    client.Dispose();
}
```
### Retrieve and Check Custom Flags in Email Messages
Retrieving messages to check for custom flags is crucial for maintaining organized email workflows.

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how you can list all messages in a folder and check if any have specific keywords set as flags.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. List All Messages**
Select the Inbox folder and retrieve message information:
```csharp
client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
ImapMessageInfoCollection messageInfos = client.ListMessages();
```
**2. Check for Keywords**
Iterate through messages to find those with specific keywords as flags:
```csharp
try
{
    foreach (var inf in messageInfos)
    {
        if (inf.ContainsKeyword("custom1"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Keyword found");
        }
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.Write(Environment.NewLine + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    client.Dispose();
}
```
