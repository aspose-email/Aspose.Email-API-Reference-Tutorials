# Create & Save Draft Emails Using Aspose.Email for .NET: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Automate email creation and save them as drafts efficiently with Aspose.Email for .NET. This guide will walk you through creating and saving email messages as drafts using the powerful Aspose.Email library, ideal for managing communication workflows or queuing emails in applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Email in your .NET environment
- Creating a new email message with customized properties
- Converting an email to draft format and saving it
- Troubleshooting common issues

Before we dive into implementation, let’s discuss the prerequisites you need.

## Prerequisites

To implement this feature successfully, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- Aspose.Email for .NET library (latest version recommended)
- .NET Core SDK or .NET Framework installed on your machine

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A code editor like Visual Studio or VS Code
- Basic understanding of C# programming

## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

First, install the Aspose.Email library in your project. You can do this via multiple methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "Aspose.Email" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.Email beyond its trial limitations, you can:
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License:** Apply for a temporary license if needed.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, purchase a subscription.

Here’s how you initialize and set up your environment:
```csharp
Aspose.Email.License license = new Aspose.Email.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into manageable sections for clarity.

### Creating an Email Message

Start by creating a `MailMessage` instance, which represents your email message:
```csharp
// Initialize a new MailMessage object
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
message.From = "from@domain.com";
message.To.Add("to1@domain.com");
message.To.Add("to2@domain.com");
message.Subject = "New message created by Aspose.Email";
```

#### Set Message Properties
You can customize the email further by setting properties such as:
- **HTML Body:** Allows for rich text formatting.
  ```csharp
  message.IsBodyHtml = true;
  message.HtmlBody = "<b>This line is in bold.</b> <br/> <br/><font color=blue>This line is in blue color</font>";
  ```

### Converting to a Draft Format
To save the email as an unsent draft, convert it using `MapiMessage`:
```csharp
// Convert MailMessage to MapiMessage
MapiMessage mapiMsg = MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(message);

// Set message flags for draft status
mapiMsg.SetMessageFlags(MapiMessageFlags.MSGFLAG_UNSENT | MapiMessageFlags.MSGFLAG_FROMME);
```

### Saving the Draft Email
Finally, save your email as a `.msg` file to specify it's a draft:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string dstEmail = dataDir + "New-Draft.msg";

// Save the message in MSG format
mapiMsg.Save(dstEmail);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure paths are correctly specified.
- Verify Aspose.Email library is properly installed and licensed.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to create drafts programmatically can be beneficial for:
1. **Automated Email Queuing:** Queue emails in a CRM system before sending them out.
2. **Email Templates:** Store email templates as drafts for quick access and customization.
3. **Batch Processing:** Automate batch email processing tasks without immediate delivery.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using Aspose.Email:
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing objects that are no longer needed.
- Use the latest version of Aspose.Email to benefit from optimizations and new features.
- Monitor application resource usage, especially in high-load scenarios.
