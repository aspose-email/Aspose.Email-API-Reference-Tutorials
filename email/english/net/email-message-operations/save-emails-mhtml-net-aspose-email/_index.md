```

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to load emails and save them with custom MHT options.

### Loading an Email Message from a File

#### Overview
Loading email messages is straightforward with Aspose.Email. Start by reading a `.msg` file and preparing it for conversion.

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Load the Message
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string fileName = "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg";

// Load the email message from the specified file path
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + fileName);
```

### Saving Emails as MHTML

#### Overview
Saving emails as MHT files preserves their content, including attachments and rich formatting.

#### Step 2: Configure MHT Save Options
```csharp
MhtSaveOptions options = new MhtSaveOptions();

// Customize rendering options for headers and calendar events
options.MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader | MhtFormatOptions.RenderCalendarEvent;

// Define custom templates for various properties
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.Start] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.End] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>End:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.Recurrence] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Recurrence:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.RecurrencePattern] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>RecurrencePattern:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.Organizer] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>Organizer:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.RequiredAttendees] = "<span class='headerLineTitle'>RequiredAttendees:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
```

#### Step 3: Save the Email as MHTML
```csharp
msg.Save(dataDir + "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.mhtml", options);
```

### Configuring MHT Save Options in Detail

Explore further customization for email elements:
- **Start and End Properties**: Use custom HTML templates to format start and end times.
- **Recurrence Details**: Customize recurrence information rendering for clarity.
- **Organizer and Attendees**: Highlight key participants in the MHTML output for easy reference.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that your `MhtSaveOptions` configurations match your requirements if emails aren't rendering as expected.

## Practical Applications

Saving emails as MHT files offers several benefits:
1. **Email Archiving**: Store and retrieve email archives without losing formatting or attachments.
2. **Web Portals**: Display emails in web applications where users can view formatted messages directly.
3. **Legal Documentation**: Maintain a clear record of communications for legal purposes, preserving all original details.
