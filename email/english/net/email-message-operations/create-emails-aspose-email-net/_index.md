## Setting Up Aspose.Email for .NET

To begin using Aspose.Email, you need to add it to your project. Here's how:

**Using the .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Email
```

**With Package Manager in Visual Studio:**

```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open NuGet Package Manager and search for "Aspose.Email"
- Install the latest version

### License Acquisition:
To use Aspose.Email, you can either:

- **Free Trial**: Download a trial package to test features.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Buy a full license for production use.

Once installed, initialize your project with the following setup:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

// Initialize your application here
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down this guide into two main features: creating and configuring an email message, and saving it in various formats.

### Creating and Configuring an Email Message

This feature demonstrates how to create a new email, set its properties, and save it as an EML file.

#### Overview
Creating emails programmatically involves setting up the subject, body content, sender, recipients, and other configurations. We'll use Aspose.Email for .NET to achieve this efficiently.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Create a New Email Message**

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;

// Start by creating an instance of the MailMessage class
MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

This step initializes a `MailMessage` object, which serves as the foundation for our email.

**2. Set Subject and HTML Body Content**

```csharp
// Assign a subject to your message
message.Subject = "New message created by Aspose.Email for .NET";

// Enable HTML content in the body
message.IsBodyHtml = true;
message.HtmlBody = "<b>This line is in bold.</b> <br/> <br/><font color=blue>This line is in blue color</font>";
```

Setting an HTML body allows you to format your email with rich text and styling.

**3. Configure Sender Information**

```csharp
// Define the sender's email address
message.From = "from@domain.com";
```

The `From` property specifies who sends the email.

**4. Add Recipients (TO and CC)**

```csharp
// Add primary recipients
message.To.Add("to1@domain.com");
message.To.Add("to2@domain.com");

// Add carbon copy recipients
message.CC.Add("cc1@domain.com");
message.CC.Add("cc2@domain.com");
```

The `To` and `CC` properties list the email addresses of recipients.

**5. Save Message in EML Format**

```csharp
// Specify the path to save your email message
string dstEmail = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\Message.eml";
message.Save(dstEmail, SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

This step saves the configured email as an EML file, ready for further use or distribution.

### Saving an Email Message in Different Formats

Aspose.Email supports saving emails in various formats such as EML, MSG, and MHTML. Here, we focus on EML format.

#### Overview
After creating your email message, you can save it in different formats to meet specific needs.

**1. Save the MailMessage Object**

```csharp
// Ensure 'message' is configured with necessary details
string dstEmail = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\Message.eml";
message.Save(dstEmail, SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
```

This step confirms that your email is saved in EML format, which can be opened by standard email clients.

5. **Bulk Email Campaigns**: Efficiently manage and send bulk emails for marketing purposes.
