### Initialize Exchange Client
**Overview**: This feature allows you to connect securely to an Exchange server using credentials.

#### Step 1: Create ExchangeClient Instance
```csharp
public static IEWSClient InitializeExchangeClient()
{
    return EWSClient.GetEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");
}
```
**Explanation**:

{
    EmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new EmlLoadOptions();
    loadOptions.PreferredTextEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
    loadOptions.PreserveTnefAttachments = true;

    return MailMessage.Load(filePath, loadOptions);
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- **Preferred Text Encoding**: Ensures proper character representation.
